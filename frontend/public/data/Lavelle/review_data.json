The staff did not give us the table we had requested in advance, and their attitude felt unwelcoming.<br><br>The quality of the food was underwhelming and not what we expected for the price. On top of that, the waitstaff seemed uninterested and unfriendly \u2014 it felt like they were looking down on us rather than trying to help.<br><br>Also, the security staff were not professional or polite, which added to the overall negative atmosphere.<br><br>We were really looking forward to our night, but sadly, we left disappointed. I hope the management takes this kind of feedback seriously.",

    "review": "I keep putting off this review for quite some time because of my travelling back and forth but the experience I've had here the first night was so terrifying I now have PTSD. The Security staff here is extremely hostile. I've never experienced anything like this. The general service is terrible it took a long time before I could even get an order in but the bartender was pleasant. When you get there for the first time it's so confusing you don't even know where you're going because its two different clubs and the security is rushing you to move out the way even if the traffic is slow. My friend and I didn't like the environment with the staff and the service so we decided to leave. Upon leaving I'm trying to get my things in my purse so I'm walking slowly but still walking up the stairs and the female staff was rushing me to leave so I walked away. As soon as turned the corner and I get outside the two male guards shouted at me telling me to move out the way while I was still walking and leaving out the exit but clearly I was already leaving. Things escalated while I said I was already leaving but it seemed like they just wanted a confrontation and they tagged teamed and started a commotion.  It was so loud and embarrassing and I feared for my life as a woman much smaller than them with those two guards who kept coming towards me shouting when I was just trying to leave in peace.  A group of guys walked by and even said don't go there because that's how they are that they've also had terrible experiences. I have never in my life experienced this and don't ever want to again. It was not worth it for a night out at all. I complained but I lost contact with management but clearly they don't care.",

This is beyond what I\u2019ve seen in Miami, Sydney, Barcelona, London, Paris, Berlin, or anywhere else in the world. This is crazy. This is the most racist place in the world. The line seems like a social experiment. Toronto is also the worst place in the world to go out. They wonder why they don\u2019t have hot people in the club or hot women. First off - they try to charge them $60 cover. Everyone knows hot women don\u2019t pay or stand in line and I\u2019ve seen the hottest women in the world in their lines. Nowhere else but Toronto do these woman stand in line. I wouldn\u2019t go out if I lived here. Absolutely not. I\u2019m not going to be subjected to that - racism or paying $60 charge. It\u2019s humiliating. IM A WOMAN. Clubs need us there. We don\u2019t pay or wait even in Miami, I\u2019m pulled in. I have 50+ promoters in my DMs from there alone. I msg at my hotel and getting in my uber and they are waiting outside like hungry dogs when I arrive there to usher me in. Toronto I\u2019m treated like a dog.",

It was still fine, but would have preferred it on the side or just less. The atmosphere is nice, the have a nice rooftop area you can walk out to, but they also play quite loud club music which doesnt seem to match the vibe. Most people were talking or hanging out at the bar, the loud club music (especially because we went at 830) also felt a bit out of place.

Our server tried to handle our tables with the assistance of lots of runners and what appeared to be a manager. They (the server) did not crack much of a smile and a couple of facial expressions could be read as frustration with our taking time to decide on some drinks. They never connected with our tables in a meaningful manner. Some of us received our meals and there was a gap while the rest of the table waited for their meals. Some of the meat was not cooked to the preferences of my co-workers (too rare) it seemed to be a bit of an inconvenience to correct. The three course set menu was a reasonable choice for its price.<br><br>The views from the deck and windows are unsurpassed. We went out onto the patio and it was breathtaking but many of us noticed the green in the water even though it was dusk and was an unpleasant sight. (Understand the time of the year but then drain the pool if you aren't keeping it up)<br><br>I get that we aren't the restaurant's target market (we are older and not hip) but the amount of money spent would have appreciated a bit friendlier service.",

I was invited by the event organizer that night, and when I tried to go inside, the manager stopped me with a very harsh attitude. I asked who she was, and she said she was the manager. I told her I'd call the organizer, and after waiting for half an hour, she finally let me in, but by then it was too late. Then, when my friend, the organizer, arrived, the security accused me of disrespect, which never happened. I believe this manager needs to be replaced because her behavior is damaging to your club's reputation.

She was working as a waitress there. She asked me to visit her there for the first date. Then I went, and she placed at least 3-4 meals and a couple of drinks while I was not even drinking, so she asked if it was okay to give away the drinks to her coworkers (drinking alcohol while they are working!)<br><br>Before paying for all those foods I barely ate, she explained how their tip system worked. So, I ended up adding a big tip so she could flex in front of her coworkers.<br><br>Later, she took me shopping because Lavelle has a dress code for female employees and doesn\u2019t pay for it! Lululemon, etc., experience items, always.<br><br>End of story: I don\u2019t know how this business is running, but hiring some girls with high social media followers and forcing them to bring their dates here to spend money while they are over-ordering food and drinks for the first simple acquaintance is kind of fraud\u2026<br><br>I hope Akash knows what he\u2019s doing here with all these girls and methods of running the business as the manager, but that\u2019s why I don\u2019t recommend this place for dating or at all.",

I have to say once seated we were checked on multiple times and our service was awesome with the server being honest about most drinks - what to get and what NOT to get.

It was 14 degrees i\u2019m not sure who thought it was a good idea to give customers hypothermia\u2026 Honestly, we felt like we were a burden just being there. I feel as if other people felt the same way as us because two people sat next to us got up and left as they were tired of waiting even longer than we were.

The dessert options are quite limited, and it would be nice to see more variety and some extra character in the menu.<br><br>Food: 6/10<br>Atmosphere & music: 9/10",

I asked the host what options I had, and she told me to wait at the bar until she texted me. I waited over an hour with no updates.<br><br>At 12:30, I had to approach the front desk myself. The host casually told me to \u201cjust go sit at a table,\u201d without walking me over or offering any service. After sitting down, no one came to take my order. I asked a staff member for help, and she said she\u2019d find me a server, but no one ever came.<br><br>After wasting my night, I finally cancelled the table. When I told the front desk that it was the worst service I\u2019d ever had, the staff mocked me and laughed instead of apologizing sincerely. One of them even tried to brush it off by offering \u201cfree pool access\u201d next time, which only made it worse.<br><br>For a place that calls itself high-end, the service was shockingly unprofessional, careless, and rude. I would strongly suggest avoiding Lavelle, you\u2019ll get better service from a street vendor than here.",

Even though I had clearly stated it was for a birthday dinner and requested a nice table, after keeping us waiting for half an hour, they showed us to the worst possible spot right in the middle, in front of the bar.

We decided to just stay and order anyway, but then our food took nearly 40 minutes to arrive. The server who brought the food had no idea what she was serving and just dropped the plates on the table and walked away. The plates and glasses were scratched and plastic something we wouldn\u2019t even use for a picnic.

They never bothered to confirm with the hosts before enforcing this.<br><br>To make matters worse, they then asked us to move all of our belongings and crammed at least 50 attendees into a tiny corner with only two tables and one shaded canopy, all so they could keep profiting from the rest of the space during what was supposed to be a closed/private event. The manager was even setting up the space before guests arrived but didn\u2019t say a word until everyone was comfortable or in the pool.<br><br>The washrooms are also disappointing \u2014 very small, not wheelchair accessible, and more like airplane bathrooms than anything you'd expect at a \u201cluxury\u201d venue.<br><br>Would not return for an event, date night, or girls\u2019 night.

A disappointing experience despite the beautiful setting.",

This time I ordered the matcha parfait, chicken and waffles and for dessert they gave us these Rice Krispies.<br><br>Parfait is pretty good overall, the matcha isnt overpowering. The yogurt is plain so it has a sour taste to it. I recommend making the yogurt a bit sweeter which would balance out the whole dish. The chicken and waffles is amazing. The waffle is beautifully seasoned and pairs well with the chicken and accompanied sauces. The Rice Krispie treats they gave us were not appetizing at all however, they were very tough and tasted like cardboard. Also the pineapple juice tasted weird, our server mention something about it coming out of the bar gun which could be why but it didn\u2019t taste or look anything like pineapple.<br><br>Service wise we had a party of around 10 and the brunch itself was already busy so I felt like we were waiting a lot on a server. She was nice though.<br><br>Atmosphere is great. You can tell everyone came to have a good time. Shoutout the Photo Booth lady we love her <3 music was good there were 3 different dj\u2019s so I do think there was a little too much overlap in the song selection but it was a nice blend of 2000 rnb with a hint of current afrobeats & new age dancehall music.",

    "review": "What should have been a memorable occasion was instead defined by a series of failures in service, attention to detail, and basic hospitality.<br><br>1. Seating and Reservation Problems<br>Despite making a reservation for a birthday event, we were initially seated next to a glass station. an awkward and noisy location. When we requested to move, we were told no other tables were available, despite multiple empty tables being visible.  After insisting, we were relocated to high barstools, which were impractical given our attire (heels) and the nature of our celebration.<br>To add insult to injury, another group that arrived after us was seated at the table we had requested. Staff gave conflicting explanations, first claiming it was \"first come, first served,\" then suggesting the other party had a reservation (which we also had). This inconsistency was both frustrating and unprofessional.<br><br>2. Inattentive Service and Subpar Dining Experience<br>Our waiter was slow to attend to us. We were not informed that our meals did not include sides, leaving us surprised when the dishes arrived incomplete.  when asked if everything was satisfactory, we reluctantly said \"yes\" to avoid further delays\u2014though it clearly was not.<br><br>Basic amenities were overlooked:  One guest did not receive any napkins at all while others only had the small napkins wrapped around their utensils. We waited excessively long for assistance with even these simple requests.<br><br>3. Billing and Final Interactions<br><br>When requesting the bill, I was handed a payment machine without an itemized receipt\u2014a basic expectation at any dining establishment. I had to ask to see what I was being charged for.<br><br>The only prompt interaction came when it was time to select a tip. While I left one, it was out of obligation (hoping it might reach the kitchen staff even though the food was salty) rather than merit.<br>- For a birthday celebration, there was no acknowledgment\u2014no \"happy birthday,\" no gesture, nothing to make the occasion feel special.<br><br>This was not my first visit to LAVELLE @chezlavelle, but it will absolutely be my last\u2014as well as for everyone in my party. The lack of organization, disregard for reservations, inattentive service, and overall indifference to guest experience were unacceptable.  I hope this feedback serves as a catalyst for improvement, as no guest should endure such a disappointing experience, let alone during a celebration.",

We were a group of six at Lavelle for a birthday dinner and spent over three frustrating hours dealing with cold food, incorrect orders, and horrible service.<br><br>Almost all of our meals came out wrong and cold, and when I asked to send my fries back, the server offered me a shot instead. I declined, but he brought it anyway, and still left the cold food on my bill. After waiting 30+ minutes for the bill, we asked to speak with a manager. The woman (shift manager) who came over was initially combative and rude.<br><br>When the bills finally came, every single one was incorrect and overcharged. After another hour of back and forth, the \u201cfixed\u201d bills came, but now some guests were charged for only drinks, others for full meals, creating even more confusion and frustration.<br><br>We again asked to speak with the restaurant manager, only to be told he had already left for the night. Minutes later, he walked by our table, and we literally had to yell to get his attention\u2014so yes, we were lied to. He finally came over, only to be extremely rude with our table, made us feel even more uncomfortable and still couldn\u2019t sort out the bills. Eventually, they comped the table and refunded the charges, which we did appreciate, but at that point it was far too late.<br>the management, service, and organization at Lavelle are a complete disaster. Thanks for ruining a birthday night. We will never go back.",

Staff often seem tired, disengaged, and unwelcoming, which affects the overall experience. Basic requests are met with attitude, and it feels like customer care is no longer a priority. The presence of overly assertive security also creates an uncomfortable atmosphere \u2014 more like a club than a restaurant. On top of that, the food quality has dropped significantly. Dishes like the truffle fries, once great, now arrive cold and lacking flavor. For a place that includes automatic gratuity, the service and food should reflect that standard. Very disappointing overall.",

The venue did not announce the event that would take place that day, they allowed a guest to enter with a backpack and then the security guard came to our table in the middle of the event and kicked this guest out in the middle of everyone.
