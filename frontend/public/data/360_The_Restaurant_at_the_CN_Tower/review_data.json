Unfortunately, this time the experience was extremely disappointing.<br><br>The food quality was far below expectations. The appetizer was extremely hard to chew and I couldn\u2019t finish it. Our main course (rib and pork) had an unpleasant smell and taste! It was not enjoyable at all. For a restaurant of this reputation and price point, this was shocking. The only item that was acceptable was the dessert.<br><br>Service was also lacking. Our server was not attentive; I waited nearly 20 minutes just to receive the bill. When I asked if she could take a photo of us for my friend\u2019s birthday, I felt an uncomfortable attitude, which made me decide not to ask again.",

    "review": "Dining at 360 Restaurant inside the CN Tower is definitely more about the experience than the food itself. The biggest highlight is, without question, the breathtaking revolving 360-degree view of beautiful downtown Toronto. Watching the city skyline and Lake Ontario slowly pass by as you dine is something special and makes for a memorable evening. Part of what you\u2019re paying for is also the convenience of visiting the CN Tower, which adds to the overall attraction.<br><br>That said, it is an expensive restaurant, and the pricing clearly reflects the location and rotating feature. The food was good, but not outstanding for the cost. There are several high-end restaurants in Toronto where you can get better overall value and more impressive dishes for the same price or less.<br><br>There were a few solid steak options on the menu. The striploin was good, cooked properly and flavorful, but not exceptional. The salmon was decent and enjoyable, while the pasta was just average. They offer a good selection of wines and have a beautiful wine cellar. The staff were nice and polite, knowledgeable about the menu, and generally attentive. However, at times they seemed rushed, wanting to serve quickly and move on to the next table, which made the dining experience feel slightly hurried rather than relaxed. With such stunning views and a premium price point, a slower, more attentive pace would have made the evening feel even more special. It\u2019s also family-friendly with a kids menu available, which is a nice touch.",

    "review": "At nearly $20, the \u201ctruffle fries\u201d were a notable disappointment. Rather than properly infused or finished fries, the dish consisted of what appeared to be standard fries accompanied by a truffle dipping sauce, a distinction that was not made clear on the menu. In a restaurant positioned at this level, one expects more thoughtful execution and transparency, particularly with something marketed as truffle fries. As shown in the attached photo, the presentation and preparation did not reflect the premium description.<br><br>The crab and corn chowder was similarly underwhelming. While the concept is appealing, the dish lacked the depth, balance, and refinement one would anticipate at this price point. I have attached a photo for reference.<br><br>With a bill approaching $400 for two, the concern is not the cost itself but the inconsistency between pricing and delivery. The steak, however, was well prepared and satisfying, and it stood out as the highlight of the meal.<br><br>Service was exceptional. The servers were extremely warm, attentive, and professional throughout the evening. They checked on us frequently without being intrusive and kindly offered to take photos of my fianc\u00e9e and me, which added a thoughtful and memorable touch to the experience.<br><br>Overall, while the hospitality was outstanding and certain elements delivered, some menu items fell short of the standard the setting and price suggest.",

We spent over $300 expecting a nice evening for a special occasion, but unfortunately it turned into a frustrating and uncomfortable night.<br>The service was particularly poor. Our server repeatedly invaded our personal space while speaking to us, standing far too close and making the experience awkward. Professionalism and basic courtesy were clearly lacking. For a restaurant charging premium prices, the level of service simply did not match the cost.<br>To make matters worse, there was a mandatory 25% gratuity automatically added to the bill. While I understand service charges in some establishments, it felt unjustified given the quality of service we received. A mandatory tip at that percentage should reflect exceptional service \u2014 not the opposite.<br>Overall, this was not worth the money, especially for a date night or celebration. There are many better restaurants that offer quality food, professional service, and a much more comfortable dining atmosphere. I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere for a special evening out.",

    "review": "I have attended 360 on a few occasions in the past, and had good experiences, so for this special occasion I thought it would be nice to have it at 360. On this occasion it was for my wife\u2019s 65th birthday and our 40th anniversary, which both fell on the date of our visit at 360.<br><br>I typically can be bothered to spend time writing reviews, but on this occasion I felt so disappointed that I must devote time to share this.<br><br>Despite having a reservation (5 adults, 2 children, and a baby) we were simply sat at an empty table which happened to be close to  the entrance. Although I also reserved a high-chair, one was not provided. Prior to being seated I specifically requested the bill be brought to me, yet it wasn\u2019t. Rather it was provided to one of my guests.<br><br>Service was incredibly slow and waiters had to be repeatedly called over for order taking/service. The Sommelier was clearly unfamiliar with wine-pairing and or available stock. Waiter decanted a 25 year-old vintage as if filling a glass of carbonated water. Almost all meals were served with an overwhelming amount of course-ground black peppercorn, not allowing for any other notable favour. Meals were not in keeping with cook requests (eg. medium prime rib initially served  well-done, then served rare). Custom ordered dessert (2 cakes) were not as ordered, apart from one of them being dropped before arriving to the table. In fairness to 360, I was informed of the mishap and a tray of assorted desserts was substituted and the cost of the original desserts was waived.<br><br>While I understand the concept of a minimum prefixed tip rate for larger groups (20%), it does not promote an incentive for exemplary customer service or allow for adjustment to the tip for substandard service.<br><br>Despite having drawn the shortcomings (via email) to the restaurant management (M. Scott), I was simply offered to return (up to 4 people) where a 20% discount would be applied. However response to all my concerns was simply ignored. So essentially I paid a bill and 20% tip for 8 people, and 360 is willing to have 4 people come back for dinner tip-free.<br><br>Sure seems unfair or truly considerate.<br><br>But how can you expect staff to be customer service driven, with such an attitude and lack of genuine care by management.<br><br>So beware and really give serious thought about where you host your special occasion. It seems current 360 management focuses and relies on tourists (1 time customers) rather than developing an environment for repeat customers, or caring about contributing to ensuring a positive special occasion.",

Thank you so much for your attention to detail and care and the love of service you give.<br>The food was good. The view was great. Our steaks were all well cooked! The crab and corn chowder was exceptional!",

The kids menu was very appropriate for kids pallets which I appreciated. Adults menu was great too and nice nod to Canadian food (ie. Arctic char and sourdough from a local toronto bakery). Only areas for improvement is to the facilities. It needs some TLC as some chairs were not comfortable & chipped corners of the table. Cleanliness can be improved as well as many marble post that appeared as we routed around the restaurant were dirty. Being the first sitting at 11:30am, I would have hoped these were wiped down the night before or prior to opening. These are the two areas that needs more attention and improvement.",

    "review": "First , food safety is the most important thing, my son of 2 years old found several plastic paper in his soup, and the server said this is just tomato sauce reheat generated layer. Excuse me? Which tomato generate layer that makes plastic sound and is not possible to tear? If it was not a family group meal and I didn\u2019t want to ruin the meal, I had already left the restaurant. The fact that this is kid soup and it could be offered to any other kids less than 2 and may not even tell that it was plastic and ate it made me feel so bad.<br>Then they forced to charge 20% tips without negotiation. If you question that, they will say this is already shown in your reservation.<br>Will never come back again and do not recommend.",

The only truly off-putting thing is that to start we were seated in the \"upper section\"; thankfully we were able to be moved to the lower section by the windows for the second half of our meal. The price-justification and cachet of the 360 restaurant are the views of course, and the upper section is a completely subpar experience by comparison. When booking, make sure you book for the \"lower\" window level. Honestly, other than tables for two right by the half-wall, they should not be seating anyone on the upper level at all. Our 2nd half experience was absolutely amazing, but if we had not been able to move down to the lower level with the amazing views I can tell you that I would have been absolutely furious and it would've ruined the evening.",

    "review": "We recently dined at the 360 Restaurant at the CN Tower and left feeling conflicted. While the food, wine, and cocktails were genuinely delicious, the overall experience did not align with what is advertised\u2014or priced\u2014as fine dining.<br>From the start, the service fell short of fine dining standards. Our server was very difficult to understand and shared personal stories (including about receiving a police ticket) and asked personal questions that felt inappropriate in a high-end dining environment. This points to a need for more thorough training around professionalism and guest interaction.<br>There were also several operational issues that detracted from the experience. We were told the restaurant had run out of candles and did not have enough for each table. The latte machine was broken, yet a regular coffee with a small amount of milk was presented as a latte, which felt misleading.<br>Additionally, the atmosphere did not reflect a fine dining setting. There was a noticeable mismatch in customer attire\u2014one table dressed in hoodies and sweatpants, another in blazers and dresses\u2014which created an inconsistent and confusing experience. If 360 positions itself as fine dining, clearer expectations around dress code and ambiance should be set and upheld.<br>Unfortunately, the experience felt no different in service quality than dining at a casual chain restaurant like Kelsey\u2019s or East Side Mario\u2019s\u2014aside from the exceptional view. Based on our experience, the quality of service and overall expectations at 360 appear to have declined over the years, and the current price point no longer feels justified.<br>In summary, while the culinary side remains strong, significant improvements are needed in service training, atmosphere, and expectation-setting to truly deliver a fine dining experience that matches the cost and reputation of this iconic venue.",

The food we ordered was terrible, my husband got the prime rib and I got the salmon which was paired with tomato sauce. Both were incredibly bland, we ended up leaving more the 50% of our food. The appetizer with shishito peppers and hummus was nice. But tomato sauce should not be paired with salmon and a little seasoning wouldn\u2019t hurt. My husband said there was a lot of fat on his steak and it tasted bland and from the looks of it, it was almost pale and absolutely not juicy or succulent. This restauraunt was extremely over hyped.

When you book your ticket to the restaurant (min 75 spent per person), you also get access to observatory deck. I went to just observatory deck a while back, and I recommend to get restaurant experience, it is much more elevated and enjoyable. Observatory deck is full of people.

Pretty sure you can refuse if you don\u2019t want to but since it is our first time & none of in a review described this, we did what we asked. Later we found out the picture they took is for us to purchase (if we interested in) for $45+tax cash as the girl came to our table show us the picture & ask if we\u2019d like to purchase it. Anyway, restaurant was busy considering it\u2019s Sunday night, however, my daughter has reserve table for 3 so they sit us by the window which is amazing! The place is rotating 360 degree in 72 minutes as we were told. We were lucky to have a clear night. The foods overall were good. I ordered<br>red wine sangria as the other reviewer suggested. Love it & recommended. I picked 2 course with mussels as my appetizer & chicken for my main. The mussels was alright & in big portion for me. I think I got 1/4 chicken leg with bone removed from the thigh (not sure). It was delicious however the veggies that come with it not so much. My daughter picked the same 2 course meal with shishito peppers. She said it\u2019s delicious & not too spicy. Salmon for her main tastes great. My husband on the other hand ordered ala carte caesar salad. He loves the dressing. King Cole duck duo for his main. He\u2019s not too keen on veggies either. It\u2019s dry.<br>Overall we enjoyed our evening in the city of Toronto. Amazing night out with lots of picture.",

Easily one of the best octopus plates we've had lately.<br><br>Duck Breast + Confit<br>Medium-rare plus, exactly how duck should be. Rich flavor, juicy inside, and that crispy confit skin\u2026 perfection. If you\u2019re a duck lover, this one will make you happy.<br>Lamb Shank<br>Fall-off-the-bone tender, super flavorful, and beautifully plated. The only note from us \u2014 we wished the polenta puree under it was a bit thicker to balance the sauce. Still delicious overall.<br><br>White Mousse Dessert<br>This one surprised us \u2014 light, creamy, refreshing and perfectly sweet. It was the perfect finish to an unexpectedly great meal.<br>Final Verdict<br>We came for the view\u2026 and left talking about the food. 360 is absolutely worth the experience \u2014 the rotating skyline, the energy, and yes, the dishes are genuinely good.

Although, the servers (not service due to long wait times) do make up for it a little.<br><br>TLDR; Food comped, steak + replacement overcooked and dry, servers + atmosphere good, would not come again.<br><br>From the start, if you have a reservation, expect to still wait in line for 20-30 min, regardless of the time of your reservation.<br><br>From being given the menus, it took a little over an hour to be given 2 steaks with fries. The steaks came overcooked, there was not a slither of pink inside of them. Mind you, we usually order medium but decided to try medium well since we thought this would be a place that could cook them properly. However, the server agreed that the steaks were past medium-well, and quite frankly they kind of tasted like they were past well done as well, but I\u2019m not an expert in food by any means.<br><br>The steaks we received were tasteless, and the sauces that came with them didn\u2019t help. While the fries were good, they weren\u2019t much different than any less expensive place and the truffle sauce was a little gimmicky. The cocktails and drinks were quite good though.<br><br>The servers, although a bit blatantly putting on an act, are very polite and reassuring. Upon checking up on us and seeing our steak, it was taken back immediately. We were also checked up on multiple times while waiting. Ultimately, our steaks and dessert were made free. However, the second set of steaks somehow managed to make one of the steaks even tougher, albeit making the other one softer (although there\u2019s still no pink). The server didn\u2019t even have to ask when she looked at them and apologized extensively while telling us that she\u2019ll talk to a manager because this experience was ridiculous.<br><br>It\u2019s worth noting that although obvious, it\u2019s probably not the best idea for the staff to loudly say \u201cwhere did that table go\u201d\u2026 \u201cthey left\u201d\u2026 \u201cwhy\u2019d they leave\u201d\u2026 when people are sitting and waiting for food\u2026 kind of makes you want to follow their lead.<br><br>While this may be a one off, I read comments with similar grievances before coming, so at this point I\u2019m discouraged from coming back\u2026 especially for an anniversary.",

He then said he would only explain the menu to that person and told them to explain it to the others, adding that he didn\u2019t want to repeat himself. This made us feel uncomfortable and disrespected. We understand English well, but regardless of one\u2019s language ability, such behavior is inappropriate and unprofessional.<br>Additionally, the server forgot the beer we ordered. When we reminded him and finally received the drinks, our main dishes had already gone cold.",

You need to reserve a table online also however you can only to up a month in advance.<br><br>I went for the grilled calamari starter/appetizer and Fogo Island Cod main/entr\u00e9e. Both were delicious, the calamari had a really nice, extra savoury taste from being pan fried and was cooked perfectly, tentacles included which I loved! The Fogo cod came with a herb crust, tomato based sauce and some new potatoes underneath. Cod itself was perfect, I was indifferent about the herb crust but didn't mind it. The tomato sauce was slightly bland and the potatoes could've been softer for my liking but overall decent.<br><br>My companion went with the Salmon Gravlax to start and Maple Chilli Chicken Supreme. She didn't care for the berries with the salmon, it was cured and she also felt it wasn't the best quality (tasted like supermarket smoked salmon slices). The maple chicken itself was well cooked, moist and the glaze/sauce used wasn't too sweet & perfectly balanced. Found the potato pav\u00e9 lacking flavour and cold sadly.<br><br>A great experience overall and I enjoyed going. You also get access to the main observation deck as part of your reservation too.",

We decided to get the nachos and it was expensive but it did come very fast!<br><br>When we got the nachos, we saw that there wasn\u2019t enough cheese on it, so when we complained about it, they came took it away and got us a brand new one with more cheese, no questions asked!<br><br>Very attentive and helpful staff members that are understanding. Their brownies were also the best I ever had and the cookies weren\u2019t bad either! I do recommend eating here and enjoying the beautiful views from the CN tower of Downtown Toronto, Lake Ontario and the surrounding GTA. It\u2019s amazing to see the view from so high with good food especially if you\u2019re new to the area or visiting!",

We enjoyed admiring the view in the comfort of our dining table. You do notice the rotation but it is not motion sickness inducing at all. It took about 1 hr for a full rotation. 360 guests have their own dedicated elevator so we didn't have to queue at all. Our server Keith was amazing, and the food, even though somewhat overpriced, was delicious! Ordered the Alfredo pasta for our toddler, and for a simple kid's meal, it was absolutely delicious, the adults ended up eating most of it. Ended up spending almost $300 USD for 3 adults and 1 toddler, including tip. Overall, it was worth it. You must reserve online ahead of time- reserved ours about 2 months ahead.",

On this last visit, the food quality was a bit disappointing compared to before.<br><br>It\u2019s definitely an expensive place, but you\u2019re really paying for the views and the unique experience, not so much for a top-tier culinary experience.

    "review": "I am saying this with genuine concern, the food I got today was actually great but our server, MIKE was unbelievably rude! It\u2019s too bad because I quite enjoyed the muscles and the prime rib that I got.  Pricey but I get it, you are here for the experience. This was my first time dining at 360 restaurant. The pre-fixe menu had reasonable options in my opinion.<br><br>To break it down, Mike asked us if we wanted still water or sparkling. Everyone was quite busy chatting as we were a big table of 10. Then came the glass bottles of water, which cost our table an additional $40+.<br><br>Then other servers who were helping Mike suddenly offered us tap water for refills after the first course was complete. We were the only table who were upsold bottled water in our section of the dining hall.<br><br>Mike was consistently aggressive the entire evening. From asking from the beginning if we\u2019re paying only with one bill. I have never been asked this question before at any other sit-down restaurant prior to a meal. He barely attended our table, his colleagues did. Most of us got steaks and 3 of us didn\u2019t get steak knives. We had to ask for it. He was also standing there supervising and not once did he offer us water refills. His two teammates I guess were tasked to help him.<br><br>When I was finally decided on what alcoholic drink to get; Mike was nowhere to be found so I had to ask another server for the beer. Mind you I waited for about 10 minutes or so and good thing his colleague came by with more water.<br><br>He also seemed pretty upset that we did separate bills as well. For a group of ten individuals. Was he really expecting anybody from one big table to foot a bill of $1,100+? It was quite obvious that this was not a family dinner. And we were a group of friends. My bill alone was $140+ with automatic gratuity included in the bill. That tip hopefully was shared with his colleagues as I would not have given such a big tip for a disappointing experience with our server, Mike.<br><br>I also need to highlight that for some reason, my apple pay didn\u2019t go through twice using the debit machine. I am not sure why either. But his response to this was \u201cDECLINED SIR\u201d both times insinuating that I was at fault that their machine somehow didn\u2019t accept my apple pay tap. I used my actual debit card instead and then that worked for some reason.<br><br>I even witnessed this guy point to my friend on my left giving him a signal that it\u2019s his turn to pay. You can see it from his facial expression as well on how he was impatient with my friend who was distracted talking to another friend on his left side.<br><br>Please remind your servers that people know 360 is not a cheap place to dine at. He made it seem that we were there as teenagers who was not ready to act like adults. I would never get this type of obnoxious service outside.<br><br>I don\u2019t know what our server was going through outside of work, but that was the most uncomfortable I\u2019ve been at a restaurant because of this server\u2019s awful attitude towards guests.",

Big thanks to the server and usher lady.<br><br>To start with, the views from CN tower lift while ascending itself is quite rewarding. You are arriving at restaurant and after dining, you get free access to observation deck and glass window floor to look through and stand on the glass panels which offer the view if ground floor from 350 meter level. There you can buy the top deck ticket for 12 CAD and ride another lift to go to 450 meter level which is highest visitors can go. Nice view from there also, you can see two rail stations, lots of highways, Billy airport and numorous skyscrapers along with beautiful lake.<br><br>Tip - you can reserve the table at 360 in advance, can skip the line while entering tower, get free access to main observation deck and very good dining experience on the price of minimum 75 CAD spent per head in restaurant, where as you can buy a 80 CAD ticket for CN tower entry, long line with free vitamin D greets you and you have to spend extra on food with limited seating, access to only main deck levels and still have to pay 12 CAD extra for top deck. So, booking a table in 360 works out to be more rewarding.",

The atmosphere in the restaurant is fine, nothing remarkable, but the stunning scenery more than makes up for it. Unfortunately, the food doesn\u2019t come close to matching the setting.<br><br>The pacing of the meal felt rushed from start to finish. Even though we specifically asked for a relaxed service, our mains arrived barely a minute after our starters were cleared. The bill was presented immediately after dessert, without us asking for it, leaving no chance to order a coffee or linger a bit. It was clear they wanted to turn the tables as quickly as possible.<br><br>We started the evening with a glass of 360 Blanc de Blanc, followed by a shared carpaccio. The starter was fine, but ultimately forgettable. For the mains, the duck breast was cooked reasonably well, but both the meat and accompaniments lacked flavour. The real disappointment was the striploin. At $80 CAD, I expected a quality cut of beef, but the steak was subpar and tasted like it had been pre-cooked a while ago and simply finished on the grill. To make matters worse, it\u2019s served completely on its own. No vegetables, sauce or presentation, just a white plate and a steak. Fries and sauce cost an additional $23 CAD, which feels excessive given the already steep price and underwhelming quality.<br><br>For dessert, we shared the white chocolate mousse. It was the best dish of the night, though still fairly ordinary.<br><br>The wine list by the glass features exclusively Canadian selections, which is a nice idea in theory, but the options were average and noticeably overpriced.<br><br>The one true bright spot was our server, who was very friendly and attentive, which elevated the experience somewhat.<br><br>In the end, we spent $380 CAD for two people, having shared both a starter and a dessert. While the view alone is unforgettable, the food and overall value simply don\u2019t justify the price. It\u2019s worth visiting for the scenery, but sadly, that\u2019s about where the appeal ends.",

    "review": "I got to celebrate my birthday here and it was fantastic! I had heard from friends that the food was great and was it ever! The tasting menu made it easy to make the 75$ dining requirements, and the food and drink spoke for itself. Starting with the mussels, they are very light with just enough curry not to overpower the other flavours. It seems to have been very popular as nearly every 5 minutes another plate was wafting by. I got the red wine sangria and would recommend it by the glass; the pitcher doesn't really make it worth the price with the amount of ice. The salmon was cooked very nicely and was quite tender. The vegetables and caviar added complimentary flavours and was a well portioned meal. I closed the meal with the dark chocolate torte which had a great texture considering it was vegan.<br><br>Overall, the free viewing experience from the CN tower was great but the food and service far exceeded it. Cheers \ud83e\udd42",

I was shocked by this revelation, especially since I had paid extra for it. Seeing my dissatisfied expression, he offered to get me a new steak. However, considering his defensive attitude and also why I would want another one if this is just how they cook it, I declined. I attempted to finish my steak but failed. The potatoes and asparagus were poorly cooked as well.<br><br>What a shame.",

I made a reservation ahead of time, and from the moment we arrived, everything felt seamless. The three-course menu I chose was $90, and each dish was a delight. For starters, I had the Grilled Calamari, it was light, perfectly seasoned, and set the tone for what was to come.<br><br>For the main course, I went with the Sundried Tomato and Caper Spaghetti, a vegan option. The grilled artichokes, baby bell peppers, and herb gremolata paired beautifully with the basil olive oil and the subtle touch of Verona pecorino. It was flavorful and filling.<br>To finish, I indulged in the Ontario Strawberry and Pistachio Layer Cake (gluten-free), just the right balance of flavors, it was the perfect finale. What made the evening even more special was the 360-degree rotating view of the city. Watching the city while enjoying the dishes added an unforgettable touch. Everything about the experience felt elevated literally. The three-course menu for two, along with drinks, came to just over $300, worth every penny for the food, the service, and the views.

    "review": "I\u2019ve always loved 360 Restaurant at the CN Tower and this was my 5th visit. In the past I\u2019ve had nothing but wonderful experiences \u2014 I often bring my out-of-town family and friends here and rave about it. I\u2019m also very easy-going, I don\u2019t fuss if an order is wrong and usually just enjoy the experience.<br><br>This last visit, however, was really disappointing. It took almost 50 minutes to reach someone by phone to adjust our reservation after a doctor\u2019s appointment ran late. When we arrived, the restaurant was almost empty with heaps of available tables, yet we were walked to one that hadn\u2019t been cleaned. When we asked about sitting at another available table, we were told a very stern \u201cno\u201d with no explanation, and were left standing by the wall for about 10 minutes while staff passed us without a smile or a hello.<br><br>Our server was kind and friendly (thank you to him), but the overall atmosphere felt unfriendly, the food was mediocre, and shrinkflation was noticeable. The waiter forgot a few times of what we requested and had to remind him but we didn't mind that because the waiter was friendly and humble and took responsibility. At the end, we were mistakenly charged three times and had to call afterward to have it corrected.<br><br>I\u2019ve never written a bad review before, but this visit was such a letdown compared to the warm and welcoming experiences I\u2019ve always had here. I hope management takes this to heart because it\u2019s not just about the view \u2014 it\u2019s about the hospitality.",

Throughout the meal, we had to place our orders with different waiters because it was difficult to find the one assigned to our table.<br><br>The most upsetting moment happened at the end of our lunch when a waiter threw the receipt onto our table in front of our parents and baby, possibly because he was unhappy with the tip. This behavior felt very disrespectful and unacceptable, especially considering that we spent more than $400 on lunch.<br><br>This experience left the worst impression of Canada at the end of our trip.

Good thing because it was very busy on a Sunday afternoon.  For a pricier, better meal you get to sit and enjoy a great view. We did the three course meal, we had the cod, it was very good. The mussels were excellent. We had the strawberry cake and the mousse for dessert. It was well worth skipping all the ice-cream trucks on the street. If you plan to go to the restaurant, get there early before your reservation. It took us about a half hour to get through security and wait in line for the elevator to take us up. Hit the gift shop on the way out! Got three new pins. Overall, this was a great experience!",

So we didn\u2019t get to see anything cause it was dark after dinner. They pack you in so tight in the elevator you can\u2019t even check out the view. Got seated at a booth and told that we would have to go back down to request a window seat and wait another 45mins! There were tables by the window free so it should not have been an issue. Travelled all the way from BC. Made a reservation so we could see the sunset not people at the tables. Food was good. And the waiter we had was good but sadly would not recommend as it was disappointing to not be able to see the view and being given some lame excuse as to why when there were empty tables by the window.

Very rude and mean. Did not like it at all. I took my parents there and was surprised and shook with the behaviour.",

He took time to ask of for photos and made sure to get all the angles, he helped us explore new views of the city. He was an uplifting energy when he came around to check on us. He made sure to help us celebrate our special anniversary and never failed to make us feel special. Huge shoutout to Imran, great host, great service and even better views",

    "review": "Very poor experience! It is almost impossible to cancel or modify a reservation, my wife was on the phone for over an hour trying to cancel our reservation so we wouldn't be charged $120 in cancellation fees and the urant when I asked if this wait time and service was typical the response we got was just \" sorry we are pretty busy today\" - the phone number has no estimated wait time, and there are no other online options to cancel. We have come here  in the past with various out of town guests but will no longer be recommending this restaurant.",

And frankly speaking the passive aggressiveness by our server Maks because he didn't get the tip % he wanted, didn't help either.",

    "review": "Dining at 360 The Restaurant at the CN Tower was easily one of the most memorable culinary experiences of my life. From the moment we stepped into the elevator and began our rapid ascent to the top of the tower, we knew we were in for something special. But nothing prepared us for the stunning panoramic view that slowly rotated around us as we dined. Toronto\u2019s skyline, the glimmer of Lake Ontario, and the distant horizon stretched endlessly\u2014all while we were seated comfortably, champagne in hand, watching the city revolve beneath our feet. Literal top-tier dining.<br><br>Let\u2019s talk ambiance first. The energy in the room felt elevated but not stuffy. The lighting was warm, the seating was well-spaced for privacy without feeling isolated, and every single table had a view. The slow rotation added a sense of movement and wonder that kept us engaged throughout the entire meal. And even with a full house, the noise level was soft, with just the right amount of background hum to keep things lively.<br><br>Now, the food. This wasn\u2019t just about fancy plating or hype. The food backed it up. My main dish\u2014a perfectly cooked filet mignon\u2014was so tender I barely needed my knife. It was served with a rich reduction that added depth without overpowering the natural flavor of the meat. My dining partner had the maple-glazed salmon, and I shamelessly stole a bite (or three). The glaze was sweet but not sticky, and the fish flaked effortlessly. Each plate was a thoughtful balance of textures and colors. Even the side vegetables were treated with care\u2014nothing thrown on the plate as filler.<br><br>The appetizers impressed too. The seafood chowder was creamy, comforting, and generously packed with tender bites of fish and shellfish. The beet salad was fresh, earthy, and beautifully plated, with creamy goat cheese and candied nuts providing contrast in every bite.<br><br>And then came the dessert: a chef\u2019s kiss moment. The vanilla cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e had the perfect crack when my spoon hit the sugar top. It was rich but light, creamy but not overly sweet. We also tried the chocolate lava cake, which oozed warm, silky chocolate when cut open, paired with a scoop of ice cream that melted right into the sauce. Decadent doesn\u2019t even cover it.<br><br>The wine list was extensive, and our server\u2014who deserves a shoutout\u2014knew it well. He recommended a Canadian pinot noir that paired perfectly with the steak, and he was warm, attentive, and genuinely passionate about the menu. Every interaction felt authentic, not scripted.<br><br>Another bonus? Dining at 360 includes admission to the CN Tower observation deck, which means after dinner, we got to walk off our meal while taking in even more views and snapping a few photos from the outdoor terrace and the famous glass floor.<br><br>In short: 360 isn\u2019t just a meal, it\u2019s a full experience. It\u2019s where fine dining meets a world-class view, where service is thoughtful, and where every bite reminds you that you\u2019re eating in one of the most iconic places in the country. Five stars, no question. This is a must-do if you\u2019re in Toronto\u2014worth every dollar, every course, every minute.",

    "review": "I visited this restaurant to celebrate my birthday. While the food was delicious, I was disappointed with the service.<br><br>When I stepped away briefly to use the restroom, my main dish was brought to the table. I had also requested a birthday message on the dessert when I made the reservation, but it was forgotten. Worse still, the dessert was served while I was away from the table again. When I reminded the staff about the birthday message, they brought the dessert back with the message, but by then, the ice cream had melted, which was quite disheartening.<br><br>At other restaurants, especially on special occasions, the staff usually offer to take a photo or make some small gesture to help create a memorable experience. Unfortunately, there was no such gesture here. The server left immediately after dropping off the dessert, without giving us a chance to ask for a photo.<br><br>It was a once-a-year special day, but I left feeling quite disappointed.",
