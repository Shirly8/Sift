    "review": "Right now, I just had a very upsetting experience at the kiosk at this location due to the conduct of two managers, primarily the thinner manager working at the counter.<br><br>When I asked if it was okay to briefly step into the store next door while waiting for my order, she responded sarcastically with, \u201cThat\u2019s up to you,\u201d and, \u201cWe work behind the counter, so why would anyone come take your order?\u201d Her tone was dismissive and condescending.<br><br>I explained I would return quickly. When I came back, I was told my name had been called, yet my order had not even been made. After waiting over thirty minutes, the explanations were contradictory and frustrating. When I pointed this out, the same manager said, \u201cYou had that conversation with me, not her. Did you seriously expect me to tell her?\u201d<br><br>She then approached me smiling and laughing, repeatedly asking, \u201cAre you okay? You don\u2019t look okay,\u201d in a clearly mocking way. When I asked for her name to file a complaint, she refused and kept asking, \u201cWhy do you want my name?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s the complaint about?\u201d The second manager also refused to help and said it was not her responsibility.<br><br>No customer should be spoken to with sarcasm, mocked, or denied basic accountability by management. I am seeking the owner\u2019s or head office\u2019s contact information to formally escalate this matter. If anyone has that information, please share it.",

Another issue was the restroom situation \u2013 there was only one single-person bathroom available, and it wasn\u2019t accessible when I needed it. Unfortunately, I had to leave my order (a double fish filet) to find an alternative nearby because I couldn\u2019t wait. This was quite inconvenient and disappointing. Improving restroom access would make a big difference for customers dining in.",

He is not only the running mcdonalds here in Toronto. I will also complain this guy in head office for deniying the food on monopoly coupons and treating customers in a bad manner.",

Also the way they treat delivery drivers from uber, skipthedishes and doordash is appalling.<br><br>I have seen it for years the blatant disrespect towards drivers. Yes, there are a lot of rude drivers too but they can easily establish rules that if they are rude in any way, mcdonalds can easily tell them to leave the premises. My issue with the mcdonalds workers mainly, is they treat delivery drivers like ghosts, they ignore them and don't treat them at all like walk in customers. There is a 2 tier level of service when it comes to walk in customers and delivery drivers.<br><br>So many of these workers look miserable here and are unorganized in my opinion a lot of the times I have visited and management does not seem to care or resolve this issue in any fashion. The workers seem like they are forced to do this job but I never seen a gun pointed at their heads, forcing them to work. There are other opportunities out there that will require more effort to achieve but I digress.<br><br>Unfortunately, I do not believe this lack of customer service skills will get better until more people voice this concern, like I have done and vote with their wallets.",

When i went for collecting the stuff for pick up order, the smoothie was half in the large size cup and the employee their gave me excuse that the ice in the smoothie melt that\u2019s why its half i said it should be full either way then he take it old one with him and another girl employee came after 5 minutes with same smoothie putting ice to cover it up i guess said the machine is not working and all. I said okay I\u2019ll manage this time, when i came home with my order and i tasted the smoothie It was totally ice and thick ice literally. They literally lied to me i have to garbage the whole thing but I\u2019m not letting it go until they gave me refund and another thing the Chicken McMuffin\u2019s chicken patty and bread was too old or frozen something I literally been into vomit!!! The wraps were okay but the other two things are just worst! Idk what mcd tryna do but its totally not tolerable!",

Once we all had our food and were eating, 2 of the most kind and caring workers came and offered us 3 free apple pies! They said it was because we were nice, quiet and caring customers, and also complimented us all saying we were pretty. This absolutely made our day and we are so impressed with their hospitality and service! Best Mcdonald\u2019s experience we have all ever had, and they were the best employees we have ever met, they deserve a raise!",

They also didn't bother putting my meals into the regular happy meal boxes, and just carelessly threw everything into the bag, and if they were busy I understand, but THEY WEREN'T!
