Papaya salad 1000/10, strong flavor, good combination with all topping, authentic taste. Khao san 10/10, I wish they have a fresh coconut cream for this dish as it still tastes a canned coconut cream, but it makes sense as we do not have a fresh coconut here. Mango sticky rice, I am so sorry but I think it can be much better, the coconut cream is tasteless, mango is not sweet (I can understand for the mango, but for the coconut cream, it makes me feel disappointed, especially for a place with a Michelin star.",

I waited patiently in line and was willing to be accommodating as they were busy. As the hostess started to seat me, another employee stopped her and had me wait to the side, then proceeded to seat another couple while I stood in the corner to wait at their convenience. If you're busy and need time to catch up, that's fine, but DO NOT seat other patrons while making others wait for no reason. Fwiw, the couple that got seated had been standing behind me the entire time as well and were not on any kind of reservation or wait list. VERY poor service and showed they only care about serving some, not all. If you're going to be by yourself there, beware they don't value your business like they do bigger parties.",

It was super fresh and one of the best I\u2019ve ever had. Definitely a 9.5/10 for the dessert.<br><br>The bathroom situation was pretty bad. There is no separation between the urinals and it just felt low quality. 4/10 on that front.<br><br>I\u2019d come back for the music and the sticky rice, but I\u2019d probably try a different curry next time.",

As soon as you walk in it does you give you that vibe of Thailand pubs and they had wonderful decor inside from paintings and posters hanging on unfinished and rustic walls.<br><br>We had to wait for 30 minutes but we order khao soi, chiang mai noodles and gaeng panang curry and for drinks I got the good old Thai singha beer and tried their OG sangria. The drinks were good but the dishes blew me away and I was speechless. There is a reason why this place is on Michelin guide. Khao soi was so creamy and you could taste a sweet coconuts taste along with fishy paste taste as well and noodles were perfectly cooked along with tender meet.<br><br>Same with chiang mai noodles only thing is all 3 dishes had sweet after taste but I guess that\u2019s just how Thai food is. Will be definitely back to try other dishes soon.",

I would advise to make a reservation way in advance as this place was packed with a line out the door on a weekend at around 6:00PM.  We didn\u2019t have a reservation and for a party of two, we only had to wait about 15 - 20 minutes.<br><br>For apps we ordered the Thai Sausage, delicious and packed with flavor.  The Pad Gra Prow and Tom Yum soup were also excellent.  I recommend ending the meal with the classic Mango with Coconut Sticky Rice.  Comes with a big slice of mango on top sweet sticky rice.<br><br>Service was okay.  Our server seemed uninterested and very monotone.  She was a person of very few words.  At the beginning I asked where the restrooms were, she blankly stared back and said \u201cI think they are over there.\u201d  I thought to myself, those were very interesting choice of words.  She hardly checked on us and did not really interact with our table or the tables around us.

    "review": "An incredible place to eat, feel cozy and get a true Thai experience. I had first heard of this place when I read an interview with Guillermo Del Toro about what restaurants he likes to eat at when in Toronto. Because of his star studded recommendation, I knew I had to try it. It is a Michelin rated restaurant and for good reason. I tried to get a reservation but they are completely booked for all of September and probably a lot of January. Because of this, we knew we had to get there early, maybe even before they open to avoid the average 20-40 minute wait times.<br><br>We got there at 3:45, there were already three groups of people ahead of us. At 3:55pm, the line grew very long on both sides of the door and until we left around 5:30pm, the waiting area was full, and people had not stopped coming through the front door the entire time we were there.<br><br>The staff are all extremely warm and welcoming. Every person we interacted with from the first person who greeted us, to the next person who sat us, to the person who brought us our drinks to our server, every one gave a smile and had a warm tone. This was a distinction that truly made me feel welcome and as though they were truly happy we were there.<br><br>The food came out so hot and deliciously flavourful. we started with some green tea which came in a traditional cast iron pot. It was so rich with history that it set the tone for the evening. Then we got the pork skewers and they were the best skewers I\u2019ve ever had. The sauce was sweet, savoury and perfectly sticky complete with a fire roasted char that took them over the edge. I would have kept eating these all night. We each got a different main dish and they were amazing, however, we decided that we have to come back to try more of the smaller plates and share. It seemed as though that is what every table around us was doing and because of the extensive menu, we know we have to come back to do the same.<br><br>We got the Thai Spicy pad Thai and my husband said it was the best pad Thai he\u2019s ever had in his life. He also started sweating when he finished his meal but he said his mouth was not on fire! I got the showstopper coconut noodle dish with the fried noodles that come standing up and it was awesome. If you like the island flavour of coconut this dish is for you. The Green curry was superb. Exceptionally flavourful and balanced. I think serving the sticky rice in a tied banana leaf is truly a beautiful touch that really added to the experience.<br><br>Honestly, this was an exceptional place through and through. Cannot wait to be back to try the rest of the amazing dishes. It definitely gave the impression that anything you order here is going to be amazing!!",

The Pad Thai was rich and savory, the curry was fragrant with just the right amount of spice, and the ingredients tasted incredibly fresh.

Highly recommend and will definitely be coming back!",

We ordered three dishes (shrimp tom yum soup, pork laab salad, and beef pad see ew), and service was quick. Food could've been served hotter. The tom yum was flavorful and the perfect amount of tartness. The laab salad lacked herbs and toasted rice powder, and the pad sew ew lacked that smokey wok flavour. Overall, very mid meal. I'll probably not be back given how many really good Thai options have popped up in the city in the last few years.",

    "review": "Since I have moved to Toronto 5 years ago, PAI has been the most referenced restaurant in the city. It seems like when anyone asks for a food recommendation downtown, \"Have you been to PAI?\" is always part of the response. I've been there quite a few times in the past few years, and although I hate what hype does to the perception and expectations we have of food, I have to admit everything on their menu is pretty damn good. A few of my personal favorites are the spring rolls, the signature pad thai, the green curry, and the mango sticky rice.<br><br>Although the food is really good, the price is also up there. For one appetizer and two mains, our latest lunch there cost around $85, including 15% tip and tax. I'd imagine most people don't want to pay $40+ for one and a half spring rolls and a pad thai. PAI also always has a line. You should expect to wait at least 15\u201320 minutes no matter the time. That's obviously not their fault, and is actually a testament to their success, but the wait should definitely still be mentioned. Khao San Road is a good option nearby for the same quality, but you might also have to wait a bit. Bangkok Queen Thai Street Food is a bit further, but also pretty solid and is never busy.<br><br>All in all, PAI is a must-try for Thai food lovers, but isn't worth more than 25 minutes of wait IMO, and is way too pricey.",

Our server EJ was amazing from beginning to end. He was super attentive, kind and had a great sense of humour. The cocktails were delicious!! We ordered the bengal leaf wrap appetizer which was presented beautifully and super fresh. We also shared the pad see ew and oxtail in tomato broth with rice. Everything was incredible. Food came quickly even though the restaurant was busy. We were celebrating a belated birthday and EJ brought a complimentary mango ice cream! It was a great dining experience!",

Massaman curry was literally 4 tablespoons of curry and 4 mini potatoes for $23.00. Same party of 4 we go with and same dishes we order was 20 percent more expensive than last summer and 30 percent less food. We could have accepted the price increase but we left hungry and will never be back. Had a nice 5 year run of eating at Pai. Sadly all good things must end. Bye bye Pai. I'm sure your customers will disappear during your battle to maintain profit margins. Lots of info on Reddit validates my review as accurate.",

Personally I loved my dish way more than hers. It was a nice kick of spice and a great warm dish on a chilly day. Despite there being a lot of people, my friend and I had no trouble conversing at a normal volume. There's normally a wait, so if your visiting during peak hours I recommend you book a table in advance.",

If you're looking for Thai cuisine but don't want the wait, I highly recommend going to Kiin (her other restaurant down the street which is high end). Loud, bustling atmosphere inside with very attentive wait staff. Can't wait to return.<br><br>I think this restaurant could greatly benefit from an automated waiting system instead of lining up on the sidewalk + stairs (i.e. use a machine near the entrance where people can provide their name, number, # of people, and then receive an automated text when there's a table available).",

We ordered a papaya salad to share and I got a traditional northern Thai dish. We all loved our food but did notice an inconsistency in their spice scale. We ordered medium heat to our dishes and noted that the papaya salad was quite spicy but all our other dishes were not. The service was great, they are very attentive and friendly with our table.<br><br>Overall food was great, atmosphere was nice for friends and family, and service was great!",

There were so many items on the menu, it was hard to choose because everything sounded so good! Our server recommended delicious dinners, and we felt it was a good value! It was busy for a Wednesday night, but the wait time went quick, under 45 mins. The atmosphere is a chill, hippie vibe displaying popular musicians throughout the restaurant. Location is central in downtown entertainment district and close to other bars/restaurants in the area. Overall, I definitely recommend this unique Thai restaurant in Toronto!<br>This restaurant in Toronto was rated Michelin star for many years, I had to try it and it did Not disappoint! Get there early, there is a long wait but they text you when your table is ready and you can have unique, different drinks at the bar. Staff is friendly and informative, servers and bartenders are attentive. Love the \"hippie Rockstar\" atmosphere.",

I believe we waited around 40 minutes for a table during prime dinner time Saturday night.<br>Host and server were fantastic.<br><br>While the food was delicious, atmosphere dim, maybe a bit too loud - I hate when I sort of have to scream across the table, the one thing that got to me is, for how popular this place is you have a pot of tea on the menu which is a lipton's tea bag for $4.00 (see photo). Couldn't even be looseleaf tea? Something that isn't LIPTON'S. At least hot water was a free refill. Should have brought my own tea bag if that was the case, and just asked for hot water. At least the teapot was nice.<br><br>Tea aside, the shrimp pad thai was delicious as always. (Being allergic to coconut food I am allowed to consume is limited) but something I always recommend.",
