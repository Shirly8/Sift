McDonald's,Very bad service and tasteless food.,2,02/06/2026
McDonald's,"Right now, I just had a very upsetting experience at the kiosk at this location due to the conduct of two managers, primarily the thinner manager working at the counter.<br><br>When I asked if it was okay to briefly step into the store next door while waiting for my order, she responded sarcastically with, “That’s up to you,” and, “We work behind the counter, so why would anyone come take your order?” Her tone was dismissive and condescending.<br><br>I explained I would return quickly. When I came back, I was told my name had been called, yet my order had not even been made. After waiting over thirty minutes, the explanations were contradictory and frustrating. When I pointed this out, the same manager said, “You had that conversation with me, not her. Did you seriously expect me to tell her?”<br><br>She then approached me smiling and laughing, repeatedly asking, “Are you okay? You don’t look okay,” in a clearly mocking way. When I asked for her name to file a complaint, she refused and kept asking, “Why do you want my name?” and “What’s the complaint about?” The second manager also refused to help and said it was not her responsibility.<br><br>No customer should be spoken to with sarcasm, mocked, or denied basic accountability by management. I am seeking the owner’s or head office’s contact information to formally escalate this matter. If anyone has that information, please share it.",1,01/17/2026

McDonald's,"Extremely slow, extremely busy and extremely rude people<br><br>Update July 2025<br>Won’t serve ice cream. They are still clueless. They don’t wear name tags. Seems only one person works here while the rest refuse to take orders or make orders. Soooo slow",1,07/27/2025

McDonald's,This McDonald’s gives out cold fries when you order from a delivery app. And that is so very wrong!!!!,1,07/15/2025
McDonald's,"Probably the worst McDonald's I've been to, sadly. Broken air conditioning (not that they can probably help that). Very slow to actually take our order, even though there were 2 staff standing around, and we were the only ones in line. Hamburgers  and buns are extremely dry, which makes me think they've been sitting around for a while. I was looking forward to a little treat. Super disappointed. :(",2,06/21/2025
McDonald's,"I go to this McDonald’s everyday for coffee in the morning around 6am, and EVERY morning I have to sit there and wait. The employee barely acknowledges that I’m there. She will continue to do her tasks rather than serve the customer. The customer service absolutely lacks.",1,06/18/2025
McDonald's,"It's a good fast food option on King Street West.<br>The food is pretty good, the staff is nice but it often takes some time for the orders to be ready. The sitting area is somewhat small and the tables are too close to each other - it's usually packed with delivery drivers, people who are on their way to the club or homeless people.",4,06/11/2025
McDonald's,The Latte Machine is always broken! I thought those things happen to only ice cream machines,2,06/10/2025

McDonald's,"This is the absolute worst McDonalds that I've ever been to.<br><br>I went to order a breakfast sandwich from them. When I did so, the app glitched out and refused to let me order. When I asked the employee if I could order despite the app refusing to let me order, he told me no and that it was my phone's problem.<br><br>I tried to order again, and when the app once again didn't work, the employee at this location repeated the same nonsense about my being unable to order being my fault and he refused to help me further.<br><br>I LITERALLY TRIED TO GIVE THESE GUYS MONEY AFTER THE TOLD ME TO GET LOST AND THEY RESPONDED BY AGAIN TELLING ME TO GET LOST. I've literally never seen customer service this bad before.",1,05/24/2025

McDonald's,Teach your staff to attend people not to ignore them.,1,04/15/2025
McDonald's,"This McDonald's offers a typical experience but the wait time for mobile orders is extremely long.<br><br>I ordered three simple meals each with a sandwich, fries and a vanilla iced coffee and waited about 15 minutes.<br><br>The wait might have been tolerable if not for the strong kitchen fumes that cover the entire restaurant. I wouldn't recommend this location for anyone with respiratory issues.",3,04/09/2025
McDonald's,"Update it’s been a month and the charge is still there. Good thing I refused to pay twice. He is scamming people and McDonald’s.<br><br>Be careful paying by card here. I paid the machine said approved and the guy said something wrong I must pay again , I checked my bank right there and it went through . He tried to force me to pay again and said it’ll take a week to get money back and wanted to give me no recipet , if it didn’t go through I would need receipt showing that it says transaction not completed, he didn’t want to provide that and couldn’t because it clearly went through. I said no I paid and it’s gone through my bank as a charge which I showed, so I’m not leaving until you call someone at head office or I call my bank right here in the store. He was extremely rude he was the manager apparently named “den” or “dan” I would never come here again since they think something like this is okay . Not everyone can wait a week for their mistake and money back, for all he knows that could’ve been my last 10$ and that’s how he’s treating customers for their systems technical errors. It’s not my fault to pay for McDonald’s technical errors, i paid and not waiting for money a week for McDonald’s with NO recipet or proof to leave with. Sickening and rude customer service and the manager should be investigated and re trained.",1,04/03/2025
McDonald's,"Stale, undercooked or overcooked. ""never again""",1,03/26/2025
McDonald's,"A simple order of a happy meal and an extra drink... Took 15 minutes and others ordering more food items after were served before mine. Staff looks confused about what they are doing and slow moving. Got the food and was barely warm, fries were cold.",1,03/23/2025
McDonald's,"Order is simply wrong. Be careful, there is like a 20% chance you will be scammed.<br><br>Edit: it somehow got worse. They just ignore the number system to boost their metrics and game the system to their corp. HQ.",1,03/20/2025
McDonald's,"I’ll be honest I don’t usually leave review (especially for fast food places) but I went in at about 430am while it was freezing outside waiting for my food. The manager let me wait inside the restaurant while my food was being made, and while I was waiting the customer service girl offered me a water while I waited. It may seem like something small but I’ve been to McDonald’s hundreds of times and was the first time I was offered a water while waiting for my food. It may seem like a small gesture, but given that it was the first time I was given this kind of service at a fast food restaurant, it made me very impressed with the experience.<br><br>I hope management reads this and praises the middle eastern girl that served me at 430am on February 8th, 2025.",5,02/08/2025

McDonald's,GREAT PLACE! Manager Dan and Lebeth are the best!,5,11/21/2024
McDonald's,Nice small location on King St West.,5,11/18/2024
McDonald's,"I experienced fast service, which was great, but I noticed that Uber Eats and SkipTheDishes orders seemed to be prioritized over in-person customers. Another issue was the restroom situation – there was only one single-person bathroom available, and it wasn’t accessible when I needed it. Unfortunately, I had to leave my order (a double fish filet) to find an alternative nearby because I couldn’t wait. This was quite inconvenient and disappointing. Improving restroom access would make a big difference for customers dining in.",2,11/18/2024
McDonald's,Went to front counter to order the food around 6:40pm there was a manager his name was DAN. He was so rude with my frnd and me as like he is frustrated of his job. We had monopoly coupons and he denied to give the food on monopoly coupons. I request to general manager to please train him how to treat a customers as customers are your guest. He is not only the running mcdonalds here in Toronto. I will also complain this guy in head office for deniying the food on monopoly coupons and treating customers in a bad manner.,1,11/16/2024

McDonald's,Rude girl working the cash at night.,1,11/07/2024
McDonald's,"Worst customer service ever. I ordered on Uber and called right away (not even 2 mins after) to ask for my order well done which means fresh meat and fries dropped in the fryer ATP in time, just for the manager to tell me my order is already ready and she won't be making another sandwich that will be fresh. She then proceeded to tell me that's why I should pick up instead, when I told her about the fact I have a child at home and don't have the leisure of doing that she told me to take it up with uber",1,11/01/2024
McDonald's,The service was horrible. I order one McChicken and I wait 45 minutes. Every time I ask they say it’s coming or not ready. Get better management and more considerate employees. 0/5 if I could.,1,10/25/2024
McDonald's,"I was a this MacDonald on Saturday morning at 7 am i bought breakfast and I was using there debit machine I was charged $8.01 cents for my breakfast and I paid however the manager said to me that i didn’t paid and she charged my card again so she made pay twice after i confronted her she disregard my emotions and told me she didn’t take your money and to leave the store I come back 3 different times she was rude when I asked her name she refused and told me i don’t have to give my name then I said I will call corporate she told me “go ahead i don’t care.” If she doesn’t like her job then she shouldn’t be working there treating customers like trash! I lived in this neighbourhood since 2012, my kids grew up in this McDonald’s. I’m a blogger, I’m gonna take this to the next level. I’m gonna make a YouTube and TikTok video about this McDonald’s. I had to fight to get my refund of $8.01!",1,10/24/2024
McDonald's,"On Saturday a group of friends and I went to eat at this location, I was holding the door open for them and a few people walked out so I held it open for them as well.

McDonald's,"This location is always clean, and service is good",4,08/20/2024
McDonald's,"Why does almost every McDonald's I visit, the workers look like zombies with no hope in their eyes? They all look lifeless zombies that have given up in life. Also the way they treat delivery drivers from uber, skipthedishes and doordash is appalling.<br><br>I have seen it for years the blatant disrespect towards drivers. Yes, there are a lot of rude drivers too but they can easily establish rules that if they are rude in any way, mcdonalds can easily tell them to leave the premises. My issue with the mcdonalds workers mainly, is they treat delivery drivers like ghosts, they ignore them and don't treat them at all like walk in customers. There is a 2 tier level of service when it comes to walk in customers and delivery drivers.<br><br>So many of these workers look miserable here and are unorganized in my opinion a lot of the times I have visited and management does not seem to care or resolve this issue in any fashion. The workers seem like they are forced to do this job but I never seen a gun pointed at their heads, forcing them to work. There are other opportunities out there that will require more effort to achieve but I digress.<br><br>Unfortunately, I do not believe this lack of customer service skills will get better until more people voice this concern, like I have done and vote with their wallets.",1,08/09/2024

McDonald's,"Purchase a medium size soft drink on the app. Came to pick up; waited at least 9 minutes for my drink to be handed to me. I was the only customer at the time (it was midnight & raining). When I arrived my drink were already made. I was expecting for my drink to be handed to me within 2-3 minutes of waiting, nope! Took longer than I expected. I tried knocking on the window hoping the workers would notice me waiting (don’t want to be rude to just open the window myself). Saw the workers were busy chitchatting with their colleagues having laughs not bothering checking the pickup window from time to time. It was until a dude who I think weren’t on his shift saw me waiting in the rain with my umbrella, came to me and finally gave me my drink. If it wasn’t for him, who knows how much longer I would be waiting. C’mon! Disappointing.",1,05/27/2024

McDonald's,"I recently had an bad experience this morning with McDonald’s at this location. I ordered chicken McMuffin, two wraps and a blueberry flavour smoothie. When i went for collecting the stuff for pick up order, the smoothie was half in the large size cup and the employee their gave me excuse that the ice in the smoothie melt that’s why its half i said it should be full either way then he take it old one with him and another girl employee came after 5 minutes with same smoothie putting ice to cover it up i guess said the machine is not working and all. I said okay I’ll manage this time, when i came home with my order and i tasted the smoothie It was totally ice and thick ice literally. They literally lied to me i have to garbage the whole thing but I’m not letting it go until they gave me refund and another thing the Chicken McMuffin’s chicken patty and bread was too old or frozen something I literally been into vomit!!! The wraps were okay but the other two things are just worst! Idk what mcd tryna do but its totally not tolerable!",5,07/09/2023

McDonald's,There was a BITE taken out of the apple pie I bought. I called the store and they did nothing . Absolutely disgusting .,1,05/18/2023
McDonald's,"I work overnight shifts and went to this McDonald's in hopes of grabbing some foods to bring back to work. It clearly states online that they are open 24 hours and there is a sign on the front door that says open 24 hours, however, when I got there I found the door locked and it took me a while to get a young man's attention who did not have any uniform indicating he was a McDonald's employee, and when I asked him if I could just order a meal to go, he said we're closed right now. Naturally I was confused as the sign right to the left of me said open 24 hours. When I questioned the young man about this he said we close down every night for about an hour for cleaning purposes. My response was "" so then you are not open 24 hours a day? "". To which he responded. Yes we are. And I again said then why can I not order food right now? And he again said we're closed for cleaning until about 4:30 a.m. The conversation was obviously going to continue in this ridiculous redundant circle and I don't have time for that idiocy, so I politely suggested that he update his signage and online info to state that they are not open 24 hours because I went there to get food and I was told they were closed, to which he just shrugged as a response. Bottom line, I will not take a chance in driving all the way there again on what is the equivalent of my lunch break to get food and have this ridiculous circumstance stand in my way once more so overall I recommends not going to this McDonald's because they are not open 24 hours. They are open whenever they feel like. Being that I have worked in the hospitality industry for well over a decade, I know that I have a unique perspective to some degree, but this was absurd. By all means, try your luck with this McDonald's that is supposedly open 24 hours but don't be surprised if you encounter the same outcome.",1,05/15/2023

McDonald's,After hours the experience is awful. It's like trying to order a McDonald's through a porthole on the Titanic. Pandemonium and confusion inside the store and all you can do is watch and hope that they remember your number.,1,04/29/2023

McDonald's,This location sucks so bad. Like so bad. It is simply awful.<br><br>Excluding some stand-out members the majority of staff completely ignore you and quietly mumble your order number. They are extremely slow (once waited 1 hour for them to make fries via Ubereats?!) and almost always make your order wrong (once ordered a Mcdouble and all I got was the bap) or forget items (they have forgotten my hash browns over 10 times now).<br><br>Given this place too many chances.

McDonald's,I mean I come here for pickup and haven't really felt like I exist,3,12/31/2022
McDonald's,The employee's literally avoid eye contact and carry on wearing their airpods and having a full out convo in their language.  Like I do get it ..it's fast food but you would expect some kind of professionalism. Service garbage food cold employee's I hope they have their airpod charger on shift.  The manager is a next clown he too busy flirting with the employee's to even care about customers waiting for the food. Definitely avoid this spot late night.,1,12/11/2022

The bad reviews are accurate, but direct your frustration at McDonalds and not the workers. After all, this is McDonalds, your food and nutritional concerns are tuned in a boardroom. Your long wait time is just a statistic to McDonalds. Consider visiting the independently owned Shawarma place next door.",1,10/05/2022

They said it was because we were nice, quiet and caring customers, and also complimented us all saying we were pretty.
