Lavelle,"Unfortunately, our experience at Lavelle<br>was quite disappointing. Although we had a reservation, we were treated poorly because we were about 15 minutes late. The staff did not give us the table we had requested in advance, and their attitude felt unwelcoming.<br><br>The quality of the food was underwhelming and not what we expected for the price. On top of that, the waitstaff seemed uninterested and unfriendly — it felt like they were looking down on us rather than trying to help.<br><br>Also, the security staff were not professional or polite, which added to the overall negative atmosphere.<br><br>We were really looking forward to our night, but sadly, we left disappointed. I hope the management takes this kind of feedback seriously.",1,02/17/2026
Lavelle,"Lavelle’s one of my summer spots! Highly recommend. Good food, good staff, awesome views. Not a fan of what they did with the renovations. They took away so much free space you could move around and mingle or see the views and replaced it with more tables.",4,01/29/2026
Lavelle,I keep putting off this review for quite some time because of my travelling back and forth but the experience I've had here the first night was so terrifying I now have PTSD. The Security staff here is extremely hostile. I've never experienced anything like this. The general service is terrible it took a long time before I could even get an order in but the bartender was pleasant. When you get there for the first time it's so confusing you don't even know where you're going because its two different clubs and the security is rushing you to move out the way even if the traffic is slow. My friend and I didn't like the environment with the staff and the service so we decided to leave. Upon leaving I'm trying to get my things in my purse so I'm walking slowly but still walking up the stairs and the female staff was rushing me to leave so I walked away. As soon as turned the corner and I get outside the two male guards shouted at me telling me to move out the way while I was still walking and leaving out the exit but clearly I was already leaving. Things escalated while I said I was already leaving but it seemed like they just wanted a confrontation and they tagged teamed and started a commotion.  It was so loud and embarrassing and I feared for my life as a woman much smaller than them with those two guards who kept coming towards me shouting when I was just trying to leave in peace.  A group of guys walked by and even said don't go there because that's how they are that they've also had terrible experiences. I have never in my life experienced this and don't ever want to again. It was not worth it for a night out at all. I complained but I lost contact with management but clearly they don't care.,1,01/21/2026
Lavelle,good view but over-hyped!,1,01/15/2026
Lavelle,"NYE at this place was a total bust. The music, vibe, and service were super dull. What a waste of money. I'd get a refund if I could.",1,01/01/2026
Lavelle,Worse New Year’s party ever. The music sucked big time so did the food. The whole thing was a flop,1,01/01/2026
Lavelle,"We came Saturday evening, it was a great dining experience. The ambiance is a great music was good, the staff super friendly very attentive to your tables. We didn’t have to once call anyone over, water was refilled right away, the follow up on food was excellent. Everything was on point.<br>The food was very tasty. We ordered two wagyu burger combos, one salmon, one sirloin plate two apps which was just prepared exceptionally well!<br>I ordered a pineapple mocktail though I could have had several of them they were refreshing.<br>The dessert was ice cream and lava cake.<br>I love the roof top, the view of the CN tower is great,so is seeing the rest of the city.<br>I’m sure we will come again try it out in the summer. I love that there is a swimming pool.",5,12/23/2025
Lavelle,"I’m a flight attendant. I have been out across the world in over 200 cities and I know that people of colour experience racism when going out. I’ve seen it everywhere. This is beyond what I’ve seen in Miami, Sydney, Barcelona, London, Paris, Berlin, or anywhere else in the world. This is crazy. This is the most racist place in the world. The line seems like a social experiment. Toronto is also the worst place in the world to go out. They wonder why they don’t have hot people in the club or hot women. First off - they try to charge them $60 cover. Everyone knows hot women don’t pay or stand in line and I’ve seen the hottest women in the world in their lines. Nowhere else but Toronto do these woman stand in line. I wouldn’t go out if I lived here. Absolutely not. I’m not going to be subjected to that - racism or paying $60 charge. It’s humiliating. IM A WOMAN. Clubs need us there. We don’t pay or wait even in Miami, I’m pulled in. I have 50+ promoters in my DMs from there alone. I msg at my hotel and getting in my uber and they are waiting outside like hungry dogs when I arrive there to usher me in. Toronto I’m treated like a dog.",1,12/21/2025
Lavelle,"My favorite rooftop in all of Toronto! 🇨🇦🗼<br>I really love the decor and design of the space, but the food can definitely improve.",4,12/19/2025
Lavelle,"Lavelle has a lot of potential but unfortunately the crowd this venue attracts doesn’t allow it to succeed. Every time I come here, I’m always reminded why I shouldnt. The people who come to Lavelle are good for nothing maniacs. They have no respect for anyone. they will push you and make hand gestures to shoo you away when you’re trying to move around you instead of saying excuse me. They scream and talk so loudly. They will bud in line. They will stand around acting like they’re some top g yet they’re rlly not. Like buddy you’re literally from the suburbs relax. Don’t be acting like you’re all that just because you took one cn tower pic at Lavelle. Anyways come here for the pics and that’s it. Music is good sometimes",2,12/16/2025
Lavelle,"We came last Friday for a company event and honestly had a great time. The atmosphere was super nice, the DJ kept the energy just right, and the food was really on point. Overall, we all left happy,  great spot for a nice Friday night.",5,12/11/2025
Lavelle,Music is so loud and At the end the server make the face because we didnt give her the tip even the all the window side tables are empty they didnt give us the window table when we ask them food is also not up the mark,1,12/01/2025
Lavelle,My company hosted our annual holiday party here and we really had a great time. The rooftop hall was gorgeous. The staff was gracious and attentive. The food and drinks were amazing. I loved the chocolate mousse and the steak. Would love to visit this place again.,5,11/28/2025
Lavelle,"Very nice location, but honestly the service is garbage. I was sitting at the bar waiting for a drink for 30 mins, Everytime I kept trying to order I was asked to ""hold on"". And then at one point, 1 out of the 2 bartenders left for a good 20 mins to go get bottles. I was here for a speed dating event, and I feel they were under staffed for the demand.",1,11/23/2025
Lavelle,"Food was amazing. The Wagyu burger was heavenly. The dessert platter was delicious. The Manager was on point. He was polished, dapper and very attentive. Staff were friendly and patient. Very high end experience with direct views of the CN tower. We will be back.",5,11/16/2025
Lavelle,"Went there for dinner with my boyfriend, we had both been there before but just to the bar, this was our first time eating there. We got sushi rolls and steak, the sushi was actually quite good but the streak was absolutely covered in bbq sauce which was a surprise. It was still fine, but would have preferred it on the side or just less. The atmosphere is nice, the have a nice rooftop area you can walk out to, but they also play quite loud club music which doesnt seem to match the vibe. Most people were talking or hanging out at the bar, the loud club music (especially because we went at 830) also felt a bit out of place. But the service waa great, our server was really nice and the manager also was around helping out and checking in with us which is nice to see.",4,11/15/2025
Lavelle,"Not a bad place to spend time with the company, I wouldn't say the food was special<br>But the atmosphere was amazing",4,11/11/2025
Lavelle,"We came here to celebrate our friend’s birthday, and it was such a great experience! The vibes were amazing, and the CN Tower views made it the perfect picture-taking spot. I got the Spicy Salmon California Roll and the Sambal Soy Broccolini both were so good! The food came out super quick, and Lucie, our server, was amazing the whole night. Definitely recommend coming here for a fun night out or a special occasion.🤍🤍",5,11/09/2025
Lavelle,"Lavelle is such a beautiful place! I went there with my friends and the food was bomb seriously, everything tasted amazing. The only thing we didn’t like was that we had to ask several times and wait quite a while for someone to bring the bill. Other than that, it was a great experience overall.",4,11/05/2025
Lavelle,Had lovely time yesterday,5,11/02/2025
Lavelle,We came as part of a work event on a Tuesday night. It was a large group of us and two other tables in the restaurant. Our server tried to handle our tables with the assistance of lots of runners and what appeared to be a manager. They (the server) did not crack much of a smile and a couple of facial expressions could be read as frustration with our taking time to decide on some drinks. They never connected with our tables in a meaningful manner. Some of us received our meals and there was a gap while the rest of the table waited for their meals. Some of the meat was not cooked to the preferences of my co-workers (too rare) it seemed to be a bit of an inconvenience to correct. The three course set menu was a reasonable choice for its price.<br><br>The views from the deck and windows are unsurpassed. We went out onto the patio and it was breathtaking but many of us noticed the green in the water even though it was dusk and was an unpleasant sight. (Understand the time of the year but then drain the pool if you aren't keeping it up)<br><br>I get that we aren't the restaurant's target market (we are older and not hip) but the amount of money spent would have appreciated a bit friendlier service.,4,11/02/2025
Lavelle,"A bit overhyped in my humble opinion.<br><br>We enjoyed the appetizers, and the main course — especially the steaks — was nicely served and pre-cut, making sharing easy and convenient. However, the Korean BBQ chicken lacked flavor and was quite bland. Since it was the last dish served, it left a rather flat aftertaste.<br><br>Desserts were decent, though not particularly standout. I liked the menu choices, but a stronger touch of lavender would have complemented the lemon better — the lemon flavor overpowered the lemon lavender cheese cake.<br><br>Even the booking process felt a little overhyped overall.",3,11/02/2025
Lavelle,DJ killed all the vibe,1,10/31/2025
Lavelle,"Great service and ambiance, Karina was amazing.",5,10/29/2025
Lavelle,"Got it! Let me sum that up into a polished review for you in English:<br><br>---<br><br>""Do you know why your rating is 3.7? It's because you hired a manager who's extremely rude. I was invited by the event organizer that night, and when I tried to go inside, the manager stopped me with a very harsh attitude. I asked who she was, and she said she was the manager. I told her I'd call the organizer, and after waiting for half an hour, she finally let me in, but by then it was too late. Then, when my friend, the organizer, arrived, the security accused me of disrespect, which never happened. I believe this manager needs to be replaced because her behavior is damaging to your club's reputation. I’m giving you a 1-star review.""<br><br>---<br><br>Let me know if that sounds good or if you want any changes!",1,10/27/2025
Lavelle,"We went here to celebrate my sister’s birthday tonight and were probably among the first guests to arrive. The location is absolutely lovely, with a beautiful skyline view — the CN Tower in sight made for a perfect backdrop.<br><br>The atmosphere was warm and inviting, striking that perfect balance between upscale and comfortable. The service was exceptional — every staff member we interacted with was friendly, attentive, and genuinely welcoming (I wish I remembered our server’s name!).<br>The manager even checked in with us multiple times, which was such a nice touch and made us feel truly cared for.<br><br>Now for the food — it was definitely fine dining quality. We’d heard that the dishes might be light on flavor, but that couldn’t have been further from the truth. Everything was delicious, especially the jerk chicken tacos, which were so good we had to order them twice! The cocktails were also enjoyable;<br><br>Pricing was quite reasonable for the quality and experience offered. Overall, it was a fantastic evening — beautiful views, outstanding service, and food that impressed us all. I’d absolutely recommend it and look forward to going back",5,10/27/2025
Lavelle,"Amazing vibe and view. We arrived on Saturday night, which is obviously a busy night for the club, like Lavelle. However, there were not enough staff, and every order took more than half an hour to get to the table. The drinks arrived without our ordered appetizers, and then the main dish arrived without our ordered drinks. The drink menu is decently diverse especially cocktails, but the food menu was simple with low options and small portions.",3,10/26/2025
Lavelle,"We went to celebrate our 10th anniversary and had such a great experience! The staff was so kind and attentive, wished us Happy Anniversary several times, and made us feel really special. The food was absolutely delicious, the atmosphere was great, and the view was incredible! ❤️",5,10/26/2025
Lavelle,"Mckaila made my entire night. She was the best waitress, good service and a good time!!!",5,10/26/2025
Lavelle,Great experience!<br>Great staffs! Especially Karina,5,10/25/2025
Lavelle,"Breathtaking views! Amazing ambience! Excellent customer service! I took my fellow guests from Europe to this location. I must say I am pleased with everything. Our server, Gaurav Vijay, is very welcoming. He assured our visit is pleasant. We come to across this type of customer service! Though we enjoyed for short time, I can say I will definitely come back here again!",5,10/24/2025
Lavelle,"Came in randomly today with my significant other. Atmosphere was amazing, food was good and service was amazing.<br>We had Sandy as our server , she is vibrant great energy and super efficient :)<br>Also got to meet the manager Dhru .<br>Would definitely go back again!",5,10/23/2025
Lavelle,Waited over 45 minutes for food to arrive. Staff barely checked in on us.,1,10/20/2025
Lavelle,Took 45 minutes to see us by table and we left,1,10/19/2025
Lavelle,Thanks Karina and Dimitri for a fantastic service on Wed night ❤️,5,10/16/2025
Lavelle,"Dhruv was our host both times we went and he was the best! Made the experience worth it. The jerk chicken tacos were soft and juicy, the blue island Margs were amazing! We made sure we came back after our first visit despite only being here for 3 nights.<br>The views were great too",5,10/10/2025
Lavelle,Food was bad had one of their sushi and drinks were inconsistent. The bartender was new and couldn’t make any traditional cocktails right. Overpriced for the experience that we had. Will not return.,1,10/07/2025
Lavelle,Sandy was our waiter and she was amazing! At first we were seated in the far back of the restaurant and I didn’t feel like we would get the full experience being tucked away at the back. I asked to move to a more appealing seat and my request was granted without hesitation. There was a spider near where we were seated and a male worker had no problem killing it for me lol. We went for my bday dinner and she surprised us with complimentary shots. It was my first time there and my experience was amazing! The manager also helped out with our dining experience and I thought that was really nice. I will definitely be going back! Thank you for such a fantastic experience!,5,10/05/2025
Lavelle,Had a fabulous experience at their rooftop with some of their well curated cocktails and amazing food. The service was top notch and the staff especially Dhruv did not leave a single stone unturned when it came to hospitality. Will definitely recommend this place to everyone and it should be part of your bucket list.<br><br>Thanks to everyone at Lavelle to make it a memorable experience.,5,10/02/2025
Lavelle,food overpriced but good,4,10/01/2025
Lavelle,"One of the best experiences i ever had coming to lavelle, I’ve visited the restaurant a couple of times but nothing topped my experience with Dhruv. He was our server for the night and he’s presence from start to finish was exceptional, he made great recommendations from drinks to food and made our date night experience so much better. He is absolutely amazing and so brighten! Definitely recommend asking for him If you ever visit.",5,10/01/2025
Lavelle,"I had an amazing experience. Our server Dhruv was amazing. He made a few recommendations that did not miss.<br>From the cocktails to the food, what he recommended was absolutely amazing. We enjoyed the food. We enjoyed the drinks, and the service which made our date night experience even better.",5,10/01/2025
Lavelle,"Well, I will share a story that would be dishonourable for Lavelle — it happened a year ago.<br><br>There was a lady whom I’m not going to name here due to privacy reasons. She was working as a waitress there. She asked me to visit her there for the first date. Then I went, and she placed at least 3-4 meals and a couple of drinks while I was not even drinking, so she asked if it was okay to give away the drinks to her coworkers (drinking alcohol while they are working!)<br><br>Before paying for all those foods I barely ate, she explained how their tip system worked. So, I ended up adding a big tip so she could flex in front of her coworkers.<br><br>Later, she took me shopping because Lavelle has a dress code for female employees and doesn’t pay for it! Lululemon, etc., experience items, always.<br><br>End of story: I don’t know how this business is running, but hiring some girls with high social media followers and forcing them to bring their dates here to spend money while they are over-ordering food and drinks for the first simple acquaintance is kind of fraud…<br><br>I hope Akash knows what he’s doing here with all these girls and methods of running the business as the manager, but that’s why I don’t recommend this place for dating or at all.",1,09/30/2025
Lavelle,"Had the worst experience of my life ! The staff was extremely racist; had to wait 1.5 hrs to get a table even tho we had a reservation, and saw people coming and getting tables before us. The waitress was clearly not interested in serving us, for no reason. I have been to michellin star restaurant and the smallest fast food place, and never been treated like this. Will never recommend going there !",1,09/29/2025
Lavelle,"The service was very poor, and the portions of food and drinks were very small. It was definitely not worth the price.",1,09/29/2025
Lavelle,"Where do I begin? Went here to grab a drink and stayed the night. 1.You should not be drinking at a bar when you’re serving people. 2.You should not be opening beers with an ice lever as it touches ice and other people drinks- it’s cross contaminating. I have to say once seated we were checked on multiple times and our service was awesome with the server being honest about most drinks - what to get and what NOT to get. We had random people come up to us and say “don’t eat here, food is shit.” It’s beautiful and they had a great DJ! Otherwise, people came and went.",1,09/28/2025
Lavelle,"★☆☆☆☆ Never Again – Completely Ruined a Special Night<br>Absolutely terrible experience. Had a 9:30 PM reservation for a special occasion — I was planning to give my girlfriend a promise ring. We arrived 10 minutes late, tried calling ahead, no answer. Despite mentioning it was a special night, we were seated in the middle of the patio with zero effort to accommodate my request for something more private.<br>My girlfriend got her drink, but mine took 45 minutes so once I got my drink, I asked for the bill because they already ruined the special night I planned in this place , We waited nearly almost  hour just to place a food order, only to find out the steak and grab-and-go weren’t even available. The special dessert surprise I asked for? Completely ignored.<br>They ruined what was supposed to be a beautiful moment. Never coming back, and wouldn’t recommend it to anyone",1,09/28/2025
Lavelle,"Recently celebrated my friends birthday here, and I would highly not recommed it for dining only.<br><br>Defintely a place fit to celebrate on the roof top, when a party function is already going on. Hence, why this place is always having a event - besides that Lavelle is overrated.<br><br>The food options are minimal, and poor selection at that too.<br><br>One of the servers accidently spilt a drink on my friend, and walked off as if she didn't notice. We called her out, because that was so wrong of her to pretend as if it didn't happen and tried to deny it to her colleague and manager.<br><br>Although the manager on site apologized etc. It would of been better if the employee apologized, but she carried on like nothing happen. Disgusting character if you ask me.",2,09/25/2025
Lavelle,Went to lavelle on my birthday. The vibe was great and our server sandy took good care of us. Big thanks to the manager druv to make sure we are having a good time. He made our day extra special,5,09/21/2025
Lavelle,"Not a bad place to spend time with the company, I wouldn't say the food was special. we liked the small burgers they were really delicious. Also, we ordered sushi, it was not bad. This place is good to see the city frim rooftop .",4,09/21/2025
Lavelle,"Service is really bad, we has to wait for  half an hour to get drinks, food and a waitress to take order, no one brought cutlery or plates until we asked. Over price and no good choice of beers. This is one of the places that I will never come back.",2,09/21/2025
Lavelle,"The food was below average. Service was pathetic and very slow. They brought us ice cold pasta. Although thr view is good, it is pricey and not worth the hype.",2,09/20/2025
Lavelle,The Mac n cheese is so good!! I want the recipe 😩😩❤️😋,5,09/20/2025
Lavelle,"The view from the Lavelle is stunning and they have good food, but kind of small portions. Unfortunately, the service is slow. I needed to order multiple times a drink and it took too long. It was a busy weekend but still for the high standard, I expected more.",3,09/20/2025
Lavelle,"Been here a few times and the views are absolutely insane. Prices are definitely more on the pricier side for sure. If you’re not here for bottle service, the lines do tend to get long and wait time can be insane. Plan ahead or grab a booth if coming here at night.",4,09/18/2025
Lavelle,"We came back for our second visit last night, and if our first time was a 10/10, this one was a 100/10! The service was amazing, and the food and drinks were absolutely chef’s kiss! It was my birthday, and they surprised me with a sparkly candle and a sweet birthday message on a plate—it was honestly the cutest thing ever! Can’t wait to come back for round three! 💖✨",5,09/17/2025
Lavelle,Amazing vibe and my husband’s fav spot for a date night,5,09/16/2025
Lavelle,"Loved our time at Lavelle! We tried the himachi crudo, spicy rigatoni, a few rolls, dynamite shrimp, poke bites, truffle parm fries and corn ribs. The pasta was hands down the best, sushi was fresh, and the crudo felt really unique. Drinks were solid, the rooftop view was beautiful, and the vibe was just right.🥂",5,09/15/2025
Lavelle,Overall experience was not the greatest went for an event and had got a table with bottle service. Firstly getting in the line was already a headache as we were told to walk to two separate lines as staff seemed to be confused and RUDE. Upon walking in I realized the place is obviously not being maintained as multiple tiles on the floor are missing and if your in heels you definitely need to be careful once we got to our table which we had paid for previously for this event we waited over 35 minutes to even get acknowledged from any server which I had to request for. Food was great can’t take that away but everything else was a hot mess definitely not worth the hype!,1,09/10/2025
Lavelle,"Amazing city views and surprisingly great food!<br>I came for the view, but the food really impressed me. I ordered the Wagyu Burger — the patty was flavorful, juicy, and you could really taste the quality of the beef. The Sangria was also a standout — well-balanced, refreshing, and full of flavor. Definitely exceeded my expectations!",5,09/09/2025
Lavelle,"All plates I ordered were generally great. Their price is also reasonable. Moreover, our table’s server Tania(?) present nice service. She deserves handsomely paid👍👍 I’m def pulling up there again.",5,09/09/2025
Lavelle,The service was great ~ thanks Tania,5,09/09/2025

Lavelle,"I recently visited this restaurant to celebrate my birthday, and it was such a wonderful experience! The food was delicious, What truly made the evening special was the excellent customer service. A big shoutout to Apporva and Dhruv – they were extremely polite, friendly, and attentive, which made us feel very welcomed. Their warm hospitality added a personal touch to our celebration.<br><br>Highly recommend this place for both the great food and the amazing service!",4,09/06/2025
Lavelle,"Service slow , food overpriced (shareables are in reality small appetizers, enough for your right hand to share with your left), the real draw is the location and vibe. I did appreciate the management greeting and ensuring everything was going well.",3,09/06/2025
Lavelle,Zahra was amazing! I’ve never felt more taken care of in an establishment!,5,09/06/2025

Lavelle,"Had a girls dinner here last Friday night, the atmosphere of the rooftop is impeccable! I had the wagyu beef burger and it was delicious but the service made my experience top tier. Zahra was amazing, she recommended amazing items for everyone at our table and not only was she patient with us but she is so much fun! Will come again",5,09/03/2025
Lavelle,"Had a fantastic dinner here—the food was delicious, fresh, and beautifully presented. What really stood out was the service. Our server, Zahra, was incredibly friendly and helpful, offering great menu suggestions and making us feel right at home. Highly recommend this spot, and definitely ask for Zahra if you go",5,09/03/2025
Lavelle,"Came here as a spontaneous outing with my friends. The music was great, the food was good but our service from Zahra was above and beyond. Friendly and made sure we were always good! We will definitely be back!",4,09/03/2025
Lavelle,"Went for the first time yesterday with a friend for winterlicious had Wagyu Beef Burger and Truffle Fries for my main, so juicy and filling, nice bar and decor. Great place for a date, corporate function or simply for fine dining.",5,09/02/2025
Lavelle,I went to this place for my gf’s 30th b’day lunch/brunch/evening drinks and the place was amazing.<br>View is obviously the mainstay of this place but little did we know that the service and food would top that off :),5,09/02/2025
Lavelle,"We were so excited to try this place after hearing good things, but it was a complete disappointment. Terrible service as we were ignored for 30 minutes, and when we were finally served, the waiter was incredibly slow and unhelpful. The food was cold, bland, and took forever to arrive. Drinks were expensive and took even longer than the food, which honestly made no sense. It was also incredibly cold as they had the AC blasting for no reason? It was 14 degrees i’m not sure who thought it was a good idea to give customers hypothermia… Honestly, we felt like we were a burden just being there. I feel as if other people felt the same way as us because two people sat next to us got up and left as they were tired of waiting even longer than we were. Overpriced for what you get, and we left still hungry and frustrated. As tourists, we do not recommend this place. Avoid it at all costs, unless you want to be treated as a joke.",1,09/02/2025
Lavelle,Izzy took care of us for so well! Myiah took such good care of us for brunch. great servers amazing vibes. Will be coming back just for them,5,09/01/2025

Lavelle,"Good food, great atmosphere and lovely views. Lychee Martini was delicious and we enjoyed the vegetarian sushi. Sunset views are amazing too.",4,08/30/2025
Lavelle,"Service has gone down tremendously.<br><br>Prices have gone up, while portions have gone down and quality has gone down.<br><br>All the staff seem new, maybe it’s new owner ship?<br><br>Is the restaurant available for sale? Maybe I can make things better.<br><br>Absolute joke,  you’re better off going to king taps right across the street.  Better food, better service, and open later. Terrible service",1,08/29/2025

Lavelle,Izzy is one of the best<br>Great experience,5,08/29/2025
Lavelle,"Such a great vibe, our server, Isabelle, was so much fun!",5,08/29/2025
Lavelle,"The good part about the place was definitely the location, you can soak up to toronto skyline view for a few hours for sure. But the reality I haven't had such degraded quality food in canada anywhere. When it comes to pricing of the food it is not worth it, the food does not look fresh and also it does not taste fresh.",2,08/28/2025
Lavelle,"A pretty cool spot to hang out with friends or celebrate a birthday. I’ve been here a few times and overall I’d give it a 7/10. The atmosphere and music are great (9/10), but the food could use some improvement. The dessert options are quite limited, and it would be nice to see more variety and some extra character in the menu.<br><br>Food: 6/10<br>Atmosphere & music: 9/10",1,08/27/2025
Lavelle,"View is stunning from the rooftop, especially at night, and the atmosphere is great. Food is average. The service is very slow.",3,08/26/2025
Lavelle,Kareem and Kezia and Mariah are the best they gave us the best seat ever and gave us amazing service. They made my experience,5,08/25/2025

Lavelle,The guest services gave us the best table and were very nice to us made our day our server never came to our table,5,08/24/2025
Lavelle,"I had the WORST experience ever at Lavelle and would NEVER recommend it.<br><br>I reserved the patio for 11:15 PM and arrived at 10:45 PM, only to receive a message saying the patio was closed due to rain. I asked the host what options I had, and she told me to wait at the bar until she texted me. I waited over an hour with no updates.<br><br>At 12:30, I had to approach the front desk myself. The host casually told me to “just go sit at a table,” without walking me over or offering any service. After sitting down, no one came to take my order. I asked a staff member for help, and she said she’d find me a server, but no one ever came.<br><br>After wasting my night, I finally cancelled the table. When I told the front desk that it was the worst service I’d ever had, the staff mocked me and laughed instead of apologizing sincerely. One of them even tried to brush it off by offering “free pool access” next time, which only made it worse.<br><br>For a place that calls itself high-end, the service was shockingly unprofessional, careless, and rude. I would strongly suggest avoiding Lavelle, you’ll get better service from a street vendor than here.",1,08/24/2025
Lavelle,"Lavelle is always such a vibe! The rooftop views are unreal and the atmosphere is perfect for a night out with friends. Huge shoutout to our server Zara — she was awesome! Super friendly, super attentive, and just made the whole night easy and fun. Honestly, she’s the kind of server that makes you want to come back. If you’re heading here, hope you get Zara taking care of you! 🙌✨",5,08/24/2025

Lavelle,"Loved our dinner and drinks out last weekend! The drinks were great and the service was great too. Beginning with the hostess, Andrea, who honestly elevated our experience. She sat our party quickly at a great table with a pretty view of the city. She brought great energy to the start of our experience, and made the evening all that more fun, checking on us several times throughout the night. Andrea really made a difference to our overall experience at Lavelle!",5,08/23/2025
Lavelle,"This was an amazing experience, and I really enjoyed the food. The service was immaculate and the atmosphere was great. Our server Zahra was able to serve us with great hospitality and made sure everything went smooth for our party. Will be coming back soon.",5,08/23/2025

Lavelle,"We went to Lavelle yesterday for dinner, and my husband booked the rooftop. The ambience was absolutely amazing – beautiful setting, great music, and such a perfect vibe.<br><br>We were served by Essi, and she truly made our evening special. Essi was so friendly, attentive, and quick with service. She even asked if we were celebrating a special occasion, and when we mentioned it was my birthday, she remembered right away.<br><br>When I ordered dessert, Essi surprised me by bringing it with “Happy Birthday” written on the plate along with a candle. That thoughtful gesture meant so much to me and made the night unforgettable.<br><br>A big thank you to Essi for going above and beyond – her kindness and attention to detail really stood out. We had such a wonderful experience and would highly recommend Lavelle for both the ambience and the amazing service.",5,08/23/2025

Lavelle,"Wow. This place was amazing? Food was great, drinks even better, and the atmosphere was also beautiful!!! I went the other night with my girls and we LOVED IT! 11/10 recommend, our server was Zahra and she was so sweet! She was always attentive and really had the best vibes.

Lavelle,"First time in Toronto, and my friends brought me to this place and I must say it did not disappoint me at all. The view was magnificent and the vibe was chill with a touch of class.<br><br>We had the pleasure of being looked after by Zahra who was absolutely wonderful—efficient, attentive, and professional throughout our visit. She managed everything seamlessly, ensuring our orders were taken promptly and delivered correctly, all while maintaining a friendly and welcoming attitude. She anticipated our needs without us having to ask, which made the experience smooth and enjoyable. Excellent service from start to finish!",5,08/23/2025
Lavelle,"My experience at Lavelle, was amazing. Zahra was my server, she was amazing she knew what to recommend without hesitation, very friendly. I usually don’t eat out or like downtown but it was worth the experience the service and the Atmosphere at Lavelle. was good. Zahra continue doing what you do keep up the excellent service.",5,08/23/2025
Lavelle,I don't remember the food tbh (I'm sure it was good) but I'm leaving a review because the service was memorable! Zahra was nothing but kind and attentive and super responsive. It made our meal an experience,4,08/23/2025
Lavelle,"The person who presented himself with a bill did not bother to grab the money in cash and walked away to do something else, when I payed $105 cash and left I was called back to check if I paid or not I was emberrased in front of my friend.",1,08/22/2025
Lavelle,"I went there with zero expectations, I didn't have reservation, they kindly offer me a table in the back, place that if you see my picture is completely nice, we were attended by Lucy, server has a great attitude, explaining everything and helping me to decide what to order she literally rocks. Let's talk about the food, the sushi (Kriptonite roll)  was delicious, the guacamole was absolutely fantastic, has a different combination of flavors that make a unique dish, from the protein I ordered AAA Sirloin Steak, what a nice and unique sauce, all together makes and experience, from dessert I was already full but going to a place and no trying the desserts its like not going, Lucy helps me in this and she offers me the lemon lavender cheesecake, what a nice surprise, its in my top 3 of desserts in Toronto, from the drinks I love the whisky sour, made properly, you can get wrong with a classic cocktail, is not a cheap place at all but definitely feels OK to spend here",5,08/22/2025
Lavelle,"Kristina was an amazing server, very kind and sweet. Amazing customer service!",5,08/21/2025
Lavelle,"To avoid being completely negative, I'll start by saying the view from the rooftop is amazing! But we had a reservation and still waited 30+ mins. Staff were rude, service was slow, and if you're not spending a lot of money, the servers pretty much forget about you.<br><br>Drinks were overpriced and weak, $18 for cocktail that tasted like cheap fruit juice. Their menu only displays pricing for bottle service and not single shots - turns out two shots of rail liquor is $26 + tax and tip? Food was disgusting especially for the price, half the time I was guessing what was on my plate. To top it all the servers try to tip themselves 18%.<br><br>I'd rather eat at the queen and spadina mcdonalds then spend another dollar at Lavelle ever again, pathetic.",1,08/20/2025
Lavelle,"My friends and I had such a great experience here at Lavelle. The food was great and our server, Zahra, was amazing.

Lavelle,"I don’t usually write reviews, but I had to take a moment to recognize the incredible service I received from Andrea during my recent visit. From the moment we walked in, she made us feel genuinely welcome, greeting us with a warm smile and a professional, yet friendly demeanour that immediately set the tone for a great evening. Restaurants are made special by people like Andrea. Thank you for turning a regular dinner into an exceptional night out. We’ll definitely be back",5,08/19/2025
Lavelle,"Came here for a night out and was very pleased with everything, especially with how accommodating, welcoming, and helpful Andrea was at the front desk. She assisted our reservation specifications and made the night that much more enjoyable! 10/10 service",5,08/19/2025
Lavelle,It was a very special moment for us and Isabel & Dhruv made us very special for us. Amazing service and food was very delicious.,5,08/18/2025
Lavelle,"Visited the place after my friend recommended it to me.<br><br>Booked Patio seating one week before the date evening with a request for a table with a CN tower view.<br><br>When i arrived at the restaurant they made me seat on totally opposite side. I requested them to check my request. The staff said they do not have any table on the side of viewing CN tower.<br><br>I did not argued and had a seat on the table they gave.<br><br>After finishing my dinner in 30 minutes, I just walked around towards the side of the restaurant with CN tower view and there were a lot of tables empty.<br>I ordered 2 mocktails- luckily they were decent.<br><br>Then the staff told me they dont have the barbeque menu available. We enquired is it for just today and she said no its not available for almost a month.<br><br>So i decide to just order snacks.<br><br>I ordered Hawaiian Nachos and it was very good in taste. I also ordered Spicy dynamite Shrimp and they served it cold. It seemed they just brought it for a refrigerator.<br><br>I had a terrible experience and this restaurant spoiled my date night. I won't ever visit this restaurant again and will not let anyone I know visit this.",1,08/16/2025
Lavelle,Very poor service. Had to ask multiple servers to find our waitress serveral times. Venue nice. Food average. Not very welcoming. Would hesitate going back.,2,08/15/2025
Lavelle,"This is the first time in my life that I’m leaving a bad review. Everything from start to finish was a complete disaster. We arrived right on time for our 8 PM reservation, only to be told, “We’re very busy today.” Then what’s the point of making a reservation? Even though I had clearly stated it was for a birthday dinner and requested a nice table, after keeping us waiting for half an hour, they showed us to the worst possible spot right in the middle, in front of the bar. We refused to sit there and only after talking to three different people did they find us another table, which ended up being so loud it gave me a migraine. We decided to just stay and order anyway, but then our food took nearly 40 minutes to arrive. The server who brought the food had no idea what she was serving and just dropped the plates on the table and walked away. The plates and glasses were scratched and plastic something we wouldn’t even use for a picnic. Is this a joke for a rooftop restaurant patio?<br><br>After ruining our night, offering to make up for it by not charging for a couple of drinks meant absolutely nothing. A horrible place we left in a rush and will never go back. We should’ve listened to all the terrible reviews.",1,08/15/2025
Lavelle,"The place is just only for aesthetic. If y'all coming here make sure to order the burger and drinks only cuz we ordered almost everything with my friends and the food taste so nasty man. Its so cold too. The burger is the only one thats good. Spent 480$ and its not even worth it. Went there for bday. The glass looks so dirty too. Cant even finish the drink cuz we just saw their glasses looks so old and lots of scratched just like this. The servers were nice tho. Its just the food man, its taste so bad 🤮",2,08/14/2025
Lavelle,"Edit: The food has greatly improved with interesting new options, and the service has gotten better, love it here now!<br><br>Decent upscale eatery, food is alright, views are worth coming though, and enough options for everyone",5,08/14/2025
Lavelle,"I attended an event at Lavelle last weekend and while the rooftop itself is beautiful, the management is absolutely awful. Partway through, management told everyone to get out of the pool unless we each paid a $15 fee to use it — despite the fact that we had already paid this fee through the event organizers. They never bothered to confirm with the hosts before enforcing this.<br><br>To make matters worse, they then asked us to move all of our belongings and crammed at least 50 attendees into a tiny corner with only two tables and one shaded canopy, all so they could keep profiting from the rest of the space during what was supposed to be a closed/private event. The manager was even setting up the space before guests arrived but didn’t say a word until everyone was comfortable or in the pool.<br><br>The washrooms are also disappointing — very small, not wheelchair accessible, and more like airplane bathrooms than anything you'd expect at a “luxury” venue.<br><br>Would not return for an event, date night, or girls’ night. Beautiful view, but the way this place is run is a complete letdown.",1,08/14/2025
Lavelle,"Kanika provided amazing service! She was super friendly, attentive, and made great recommendations. The food was delicious, but her exceptional service really made our night. Definitely 5 stars!",5,08/13/2025

Lavelle,"My friend and I visited Lavelle on Monday night and had an absolutely wonderful experience. From the moment we arrived, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming, but what truly made the evening memorable was our server, Izzy. She provided outstanding service, attentive without being intrusive, friendly, and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu. Every recommendation she made was spot-on, and she made sure we had everything we needed throughout the night.<br><br>It’s rare to encounter service that feels so genuine and personalized, and Izzy truly went above and beyond to make our visit special. Lavelle is lucky to have her! We’ll definitely be coming back and will be asking for Izzy next time.",5,08/13/2025
Lavelle,Isabella was the best! She was so kind and gave us some great tips for our stay in Toronto! She really helped us celebrate a special time in our lives! Would come back just to see her!!,5,08/12/2025
Lavelle,The service is slow. It's dirty. The bartender was very rude.,2,08/11/2025
Lavelle,Nice place. Really positive vibe. Super nice host Kareem :),5,08/10/2025
Lavelle,"If I could give more than 5 stars, I would! From the moment we walked in, Kareem made our entire day at Lavelle unforgettable. His energy, professionalism, and genuine care for guests are unmatched. He made us feel like VIPs the entire time—anticipating what we needed before we even asked, checking in just the right amount, and making sure we were always comfortable and having fun.<br><br>The atmosphere at Lavelle is already incredible—beautiful views, great music, perfect vibe—but Kareem elevated the experience to another level. It’s rare to meet someone who combines charisma, kindness, and top-tier service like he does. Honestly, Kareem is the reason we’ll keep coming back. Lavelle, you’ve got a gem on your team!",5,08/10/2025
Lavelle,Kareem was amazing — super friendly and made the experience even better!,5,08/10/2025
Lavelle,"My friend and I went to the rooftop to chill by the pool. Kareem was very friendly, and we had a sunbed by the pool. Highly recommended!",5,08/10/2025
Lavelle,"This was the 4th time I have been at Lavelle. I've tried their booth, old years night fiesta and just regular hanging with friends. Today I took the baby along in the afternoon and it was the same incredible experience. The food was great, our host Lucy was awesome and the vibes were just lovely.<br><br>The entrance needs to be worked on cause it feels really sketchy - maybe paint it over and put some trims or simple decor to add to the ambience.  Also, instead of giving 1.5 or 2.5 hour time stamp for people to eat etc, allow people to stay longer as long as they are spending money.",5,08/10/2025
Lavelle,"Came here with a friend for drinks on the rooftop. The view was fantastic, but the service was shockingly rude, even insulting. I was served the wrong drink, and when I politely pointed it out, I was yelled at and only grudgingly given a replacement — which still wasn’t well made. A disappointing experience despite the beautiful setting.",2,08/10/2025
Lavelle,"The food was okay, the sushi was pretty bland and the cocktails were unfortunately very poor, tasting more like water than anything else. That said, the service was absolutely exceptional. Kanika and the manager went above and beyond, not only in serving us but also in making up for our disappointment with the drinks and food. While I understand that during busy times quality can suffer, their attentiveness and effort truly stood out. I would give 10 stars for only for the service",3,08/10/2025
Lavelle,"Celebrated my wife’s birthday at Lavelle today. Have to say that the food, service, views and the vibes overall were flawless. Shout out to our server Apurva for being super helpful with handling the huge group that we had with seniors, kids included!",5,08/10/2025
Lavelle,"Slow, overhyped and dirty. People can’t serve and the drinks are shit. Instahoe environment",1,08/09/2025

Lavelle,"Lavelle in Toronto is an absolute gem! The rooftop ambiance is stunning with panoramic city views, the food is top-notch, and the cocktails are perfectly crafted. Service was attentive and professional. A must-visit spot for a stylish night out or special occasion.",5,08/06/2025
Lavelle,"Always have fun shooting at Lavelle — the food and venue are amazing. However, my wife had a complaint about one of the security women; she found her a bit invasive and overly touchy.",5,08/06/2025
Lavelle,"Pool party in the heart of Toronto? Say less. The place is a whole mood — CN Tower felt close enough to high-five. The atmosphere? Absolute perfection. Staff? So friendly, it felt like they were hosting us at their own rooftop house party. Music, views, and vibes were all 10/10.<br>Only reason it’s not full stars across the board: the food was decent, just not as exciting as everything else. But when the setting is this good, you’re mostly there for the poolside glow and those skyline selfies anyway.",5,08/05/2025
Lavelle,"Worst experience ever! Would not return or recommend this place to anyone, EVER.",1,08/05/2025
Lavelle,"Review specifically for Somebody Anybody Brunch<br><br>Ive been to this brunch a few times. This time I ordered the matcha parfait, chicken and waffles and for dessert they gave us these Rice Krispies.<br><br>Parfait is pretty good overall, the matcha isnt overpowering. The yogurt is plain so it has a sour taste to it. I recommend making the yogurt a bit sweeter which would balance out the whole dish. The chicken and waffles is amazing. The waffle is beautifully seasoned and pairs well with the chicken and accompanied sauces. The Rice Krispie treats they gave us were not appetizing at all however, they were very tough and tasted like cardboard. Also the pineapple juice tasted weird, our server mention something about it coming out of the bar gun which could be why but it didn’t taste or look anything like pineapple.<br><br>Service wise we had a party of around 10 and the brunch itself was already busy so I felt like we were waiting a lot on a server. She was nice though.<br><br>Atmosphere is great. You can tell everyone came to have a good time. Shoutout the Photo Booth lady we love her <3 music was good there were 3 different dj’s so I do think there was a little too much overlap in the song selection but it was a nice blend of 2000 rnb with a hint of current afrobeats & new age dancehall music.",4,08/05/2025
Lavelle,"What should have been a memorable occasion was instead defined by a series of failures in service, attention to detail, and basic hospitality.<br><br>1. Seating and Reservation Problems<br>Despite making a reservation for a birthday event, we were initially seated next to a glass station. an awkward and noisy location. When we requested to move, we were told no other tables were available, despite multiple empty tables being visible.  After insisting, we were relocated to high barstools, which were impractical given our attire (heels) and the nature of our celebration.<br>To add insult to injury, another group that arrived after us was seated at the table we had requested. Staff gave conflicting explanations, first claiming it was ""first come, first served,"" then suggesting the other party had a reservation (which we also had). This inconsistency was both frustrating and unprofessional.<br><br>2. Inattentive Service and Subpar Dining Experience<br>Our waiter was slow to attend to us. We were not informed that our meals did not include sides, leaving us surprised when the dishes arrived incomplete.  when asked if everything was satisfactory, we reluctantly said ""yes"" to avoid further delays—though it clearly was not.<br><br>Basic amenities were overlooked:  One guest did not receive any napkins at all while others only had the small napkins wrapped around their utensils. We waited excessively long for assistance with even these simple requests.<br><br>3. Billing and Final Interactions<br><br>When requesting the bill, I was handed a payment machine without an itemized receipt—a basic expectation at any dining establishment. I had to ask to see what I was being charged for.<br><br>The only prompt interaction came when it was time to select a tip. While I left one, it was out of obligation (hoping it might reach the kitchen staff even though the food was salty) rather than merit.<br>- For a birthday celebration, there was no acknowledgment—no ""happy birthday,"" no gesture, nothing to make the occasion feel special.<br><br>This was not my first visit to LAVELLE @chezlavelle, but it will absolutely be my last—as well as for everyone in my party. The lack of organization, disregard for reservations, inattentive service, and overall indifference to guest experience were unacceptable.  I hope this feedback serves as a catalyst for improvement, as no guest should endure such a disappointing experience, let alone during a celebration.",1,08/04/2025
Lavelle,Very nice place to hang out with friends or partner,5,08/04/2025
Lavelle,The search at the door was shocking by the female security guard. I totally understand you need to search for anything illicit but the frisk was outrageous with touching that does not even occur at an airport. Don't touch people in areas you are not supposed to. This requires retraining and should not be acceptable,1,08/03/2025
Lavelle,Kristina made my cousins from out of town feel like they were right at home. The experience was out of this world can’t wait to come back,5,08/03/2025

Lavelle,"There was a special event happening that didnt appear on the calendar with loud speakers inside despite being a patio event. This made conversation difficult. Overall the food was good. I had the AAA sirloin, it does come with a sauce but this is not listed on the menu. The Caesar salad and truffle fries were delicious. My friend had the wagyu burger, it was overwheled by the sauce. Quickeness of service could use some work. We would have oredred a second drink but the servers seemed to be overwhelemd or unaware.",4,08/01/2025

Lavelle,"I was really looking forward to dining at Lavelle given all the hype around it, but unfortunately, the experience was very disappointing. The service was incredibly slow and inattentive — we had to wait over 50 minutes just to get water.<br>Our server seemed more interested in chatting with other staff than checking on us. We felt ignored the entire evening.<br><br>For a place that markets itself as upscale, the service was nowhere near the standard you’d expect. Not worth the money or the hype. I won’t be coming back and wouldn’t recommend it to anyone looking for good service and a relaxing evening.",1,07/29/2025
Lavelle,"The servers were so rude, a dude with dyed blonde hair couldn't catch his name was so rude. We had to order just water x3 times before somebody could actually bring water to the table. Unbelievable. I was so excited ti try out this restaurent, but had very disappointing experience.",1,07/29/2025
Lavelle,"I had worst experience of my life at this restaurant. We asked for water and waited for 45 minutes at table. The server was so rude when we asked him for water again. It’s monday evening, wasn’t busy at all.",1,07/29/2025
Lavelle,"Worst service ever!! It took them 45mins to bring water. It was monday evening, not busy at all. Servers were so racist, I could see the mood switch after they saw two group of brown people. We had to walk out without ordering anything, it was unstandable.",1,07/29/2025
Lavelle,Worst place in my life.<br>Food is delayed<br>Managers are rude<br>Reservation was wrong<br>Overcharging you so you need to double check everything.<br><br>After that they apologize and gave email for further assistance but they didn’t answer at all LOL.<br><br>PLEASE AVOID THEM DON’T LET THEM RUIN YOUR EVENING,1,07/27/2025
Lavelle,"This place wasn’t what I had expected. We had made reservations but they made a mistake and told us to sit at the bar since they had no other tables. Why take the CC for reservations and have us sit at the bar? It was a birthday we were celebrating. We proceeded to sit at the bar, as there were no other options. The food wasn’t good. The drinks were extremely watered down. And the service was much to be desired.",1,07/27/2025

Lavelle,Celebrated a birthday at lavelle and had the greatest experience. Our server Mel especially made the experience special because she was so fun to talk to so attentive and really helped us make decisions on the menu too. Highly recommend lavelle in the future!,5,07/26/2025
Lavelle,How do i get in contact with the owner? Ive contacted and left multiple voice mails and no reply after 10 days regarding my issue.,2,07/23/2025
Lavelle,"I recently had an incredibly frustrating experience at Lavelle, and I honestly don’t even know where to begin with how bad the service was. It felt like no one knew what they were doing or how to think for themselves, making what should’ve been a simple visit feel unnecessarily complicated and poorly handled. To top it all off, the washrooms were in horrible shape. One was out of order, and the other had a toilet seat just sitting on the floor. It was honestly disgusting. Overall, a general neglect of basic service standards.",2,07/21/2025
Lavelle,"Customer service was great. Atmosphere was good. Overall, a very good experience. We had the Tempura Sushi, Spicy Rigatoni Pasta and Truffle fries. Everything was delicious, except the pasta was a little too dry for our liking. The lychee drink was quite good. We came to know some items were only available for ordering inside the dining room and not the outdoor patio, wish the Chipotle Mac N Cheese could be served outdoor too. We will be returning!",4,07/21/2025
Lavelle,"Great rooftop, food was great, and service was very nice. My server Apurva was very helpful and attentive.",5,07/20/2025
Lavelle,Nice restaurant with a nice view and vibe. Was not impressed with the service. It was three of us and the waitress only brought 2 napkins and no utensils to eat our dinner with. She took our drink order and didn't come back to take out food order. I had to go look for her to ask her if she can take our order. Asked for an appetizer and told me they didn't have it available tonight. Overall service was not good.  Food was ok only and small portions.,3,07/20/2025
Lavelle,"Terrible service — honestly one of the worst dining experiences I’ve had in the city. Our waitress was completely unprofessional: she was slurring her words the entire time, barely seemed to know what was going on, and was honestly just living in her own world.<br><br>We had to ask for plates five separate times, and still received our appetizers before we even got plates to eat with. On top of that, we ordered our main dish at 8 PM and didn’t receive it until 9:15. When we asked where the food was halfway through, she casually admitted that she forgot to put the order in. To make it worse, when the appetizers did come, they brought us the wrong ones.<br><br>Overall, the service was slow, careless, and rude. You’d expect better from a place that charges luxury prices. Definitely not worth the hype — won’t be coming back",1,07/20/2025
Lavelle,"This rooftop has the potential to be one of the best in Toronto. The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful — the view, the layout, and the vibe are all top-notch.<br><br>However, the service didn’t quite match the setting. It felt a bit unorganized, with people sitting and placing drinks wherever they wanted. There didn’t seem to be much attention to those who had reserved tables or ordered food. I understand it gets busy on weekend nights, but with better management, the experience could be greatly improved.<br><br>That said, I really enjoyed the spicy margarita — the flavor was bold and well-balanced, and it stood out as one of the better cocktails I’ve had recently.<br><br>With a bit more structure and service quality, this place could easily become one of the top rooftops in the city.",3,07/19/2025
Lavelle,"I made a reservation here to celebrate my fiancé’s birthday. When I booked, I left a note explaining everything — including that I wanted them to bring us a piece of cake with “Happy Birthday” written on it after dinner to surprise my fiancé. But honestly, they were extremely careless. They didn’t do anything, and the food was very average. I told them that I had left a note when I made the reservation, and they even admitted — in front of my fiancé — that they had seen the note and knew I wanted to surprise him, yet they didn’t bring any cake.<br>Their service and attitude were very disappointing. I was really upset — we just finished dinner and left. They didn’t even apologize or acknowledge what happened. I had made the reservation a week in advance, and I even called them to confirm that it was for my fiancé’s birthday. They told me, “Don’t worry, we’ve got it,” but clearly, they didn’t.",1,07/19/2025
Lavelle,Apurva was excellent. Truly great service.. 🤗,5,07/18/2025
Lavelle,"Good food, intimateingly great atmosphere, and great service. Apurva was very knowledgeable, and super friendly, which made me more comfortable eating in a place that seems like it would be for millionaires",5,07/17/2025
Lavelle,Loved the food and the Server Apurva and her hospitality was amazing. Really enjoyed the environment will definitely visit again!,5,07/17/2025
Lavelle,"Lavelle is truly a gem in the heart of Toronto! 🌆✨<br><br>We visited for dinner and were blown away by the breathtaking skyline views—it’s one of the best rooftop settings in the city, especially at sunset. The vibe is upscale yet relaxed, perfect for a special evening out. 🌇🌃<br><br>As vegetarians, we were pleasantly surprised by the great variety vegetarians ptions on the menu. The flavors were creative, fresh, and beautifully plated. From appetizers to mains, every bite was a delight! 🥗🍝🌱<br><br>Highly recommend Lavelle if you’re looking for a mix of stunning views, a chill ambiance, and vegetarian-friendly fine dining in Toronto. Will definitely be back!",5,07/17/2025
Lavelle,"I left a pair of sunglasses in Lavelle and the staff confirmed they found it and they ask me to go back to collect it. When I go to get it back, they said they cannot find it! I wonder how they keep custody’s of customer items. I spent 3 hours travelling to downtown to get it back, but at the end I cannot get it back!",1,07/17/2025
Lavelle,"pls read before visiting<br><br>One of the worst dining experiences I’ve ever had. We were a group of six at Lavelle for a birthday dinner and spent over three frustrating hours dealing with cold food, incorrect orders, and horrible service.<br><br>Almost all of our meals came out wrong and cold, and when I asked to send my fries back, the server offered me a shot instead. I declined, but he brought it anyway, and still left the cold food on my bill. After waiting 30+ minutes for the bill, we asked to speak with a manager. The woman (shift manager) who came over was initially combative and rude.<br><br>When the bills finally came, every single one was incorrect and overcharged. After another hour of back and forth, the “fixed” bills came, but now some guests were charged for only drinks, others for full meals, creating even more confusion and frustration.<br><br>We again asked to speak with the restaurant manager, only to be told he had already left for the night. Minutes later, he walked by our table, and we literally had to yell to get his attention—so yes, we were lied to. He finally came over, only to be extremely rude with our table, made us feel even more uncomfortable and still couldn’t sort out the bills. Eventually, they comped the table and refunded the charges, which we did appreciate, but at that point it was far too late.<br>the management, service, and organization at Lavelle are a complete disaster. Thanks for ruining a birthday night. We will never go back.",1,07/16/2025
Lavelle,"Food and service was amazing, beautiful views and spot on requested seating! Our server Tania was amazing and so kind<33",5,07/16/2025
Lavelle,Food and drinks were amazing and the view is unmatched. Tania our server was the sweetest!! Everything about our experience was amazing even the music was perfect!!,5,07/16/2025
Lavelle,Amazing place with a rooftop,5,07/15/2025
Lavelle,"Ok spot. Nothing great, the dj could have been better. Food was good. Service was great, very cordial servers.<br><br>One time place. Bathrooms had long lines. Would not come again, probably way better spots in the city for the price point.",3,07/15/2025
Lavelle,"I’ve been to Lavelle a few times, and unfortunately, the service has consistently declined. Staff often seem tired, disengaged, and unwelcoming, which affects the overall experience. Basic requests are met with attitude, and it feels like customer care is no longer a priority. The presence of overly assertive security also creates an uncomfortable atmosphere — more like a club than a restaurant. On top of that, the food quality has dropped significantly. Dishes like the truffle fries, once great, now arrive cold and lacking flavor. For a place that includes automatic gratuity, the service and food should reflect that standard. Very disappointing overall.",1,07/14/2025
Lavelle,"We were a group of 8. Unfortunately, the service was terrible. Our reservation was at 8:00 PM, and it took over 30 minutes just to get a drink. By 9:45, we still hadn’t received our food, and the waitress came to inform us that there was a private event at 10:00 PM and that we had to leave the terrace as soon as possible — and we still didn’t even have our food (lol). We were really disappointed with the service and decided to leave without eating. I don’t understand how a restaurant like this could treat guests that way.<br><br>Thank you to the manager who took the time to speak with us and adjusted the bill for the drinks we had. Sadly, I’ll never return to Lavelle.",1,07/14/2025
Lavelle,Bad service and bad drinks,1,07/13/2025
Lavelle,"Honest review of Lavelle Toronto<br>Yes, the place is beautiful and the view is next level… but unfortunately, the service was a big letdown.<br><br>The service was super slow, the food was just average, and worst of all — our waitress had such a rude attitude that we felt scolded the whole time. 😒<br><br>It’s a shame, because the spot has so much potential, but the experience just didn’t match the vibe. Hope they improve.<br><br>#LavelleToronto #HonestReview #TorontoRestaurants #NotWorthIt",1,07/11/2025
Lavelle,"Great Views, Solid Drinks — But the Food Misses the Mark<br><br>Visited Lavelle’s rooftop on a beautiful evening — and there’s no denying the views are stunning. The setting is elevated, literally and aesthetically, making it a great spot to unwind or impress out-of-towners.<br><br>The drinks were well-made and matched the upscale vibe — definitely one of the highlights of the night.<br><br>As for the food, it looked better than it tasted. Presentation was strong, but the flavours just didn’t live up to the setting. For the price point, you’d expect more finesse and depth.<br><br>Lavelle is worth it for the ambiance and cocktails, but if you’re going for the food alone, you might walk away underwhelmed.",4,07/11/2025
Lavelle,"I loved the place and the views (you can take a lot of nice pictures) but the service is pretty bad. There were 4 of us and they only gave the food to 3 of us and then -even after reminding them- they didn't bring any food, and they forgot the appetizers. If you are going to eat, I don't recommend it.<br><br>Also the chairs were weird and it was so uncomfortable to get out.",1,07/11/2025
Lavelle,Great atmosphere with nice views of the city. Customer service was terrible and simple food order of nacho took 45 min to come when we asked for it again.,2,07/11/2025
Lavelle,"I truly enjoyed my experience at Lavelle!<br>Apoorva – our server – was absolutely fantastic. Attentive, warm, and genuinely made us feel taken care of without being overbearing. She struck the perfect balance of professionalism and friendliness, elevating the whole experience.<br><br>The ambiance was stunning, the food lived up to the hype, and the cocktails were on point. Every detail, from the presentation to the vibe, was thoughtfully curated.<br><br>Would definitely come back – and if you’re lucky enough to be served by Apoorva, you’re in great hands!",5,07/10/2025
Lavelle,had a horrible waitress named Tania who DEMANDED we tip her. Like I was going to do it anyway but she demanded a tip and when we gave one she said it was too low and her service wasn’t even that good like she showed up every 45 mins like she was so beg and RUDE,1,07/09/2025
Lavelle,"Lavelle is an undeniably beautiful rooftop spot in Toronto—the views are incredible, the decor is sleek and stylish, and the DJ was absolutely fantastic when we visited. The atmosphere alone makes it feel like a must-visit destination, especially for a summer night out.<br><br>Unfortunately, that’s where the perfection ended.<br><br>We had a reservation but when we arrived, our table wasn’t ready—not just ours, but several others were also waiting. One table was awkwardly placed way too close to the DJ booth. Honestly, they should just remove it.<br><br>While waiting, we went to the bar to grab drinks (which we paid for), and although we were seated shortly after, the experience felt disorganized and frustrating.<br><br>Things took a turn when our server approached and asked if we were ready to order food. We politely said we were enjoying our drinks first, and were immediately told we’d be kicked out if we didn’t order food—despite never being informed of this policy when we made our reservation.<br><br>To top it off, I ordered an Aperol Spritz that was so poorly made (just Aperol and club soda—no Prosecco!) that I couldn’t drink it. Thankfully, they removed it from the bill.<br><br>The food menu looks great, so I’ll likely give it another shot—but I’ll stick to beer or wine and dine inside next time. Great vibe, but a long way to go in terms of service and consistency.",3,07/09/2025
Lavelle,"It was the worst experience I've ever had in my life regarding customer service. My friend booked a space to celebrate her birthday, at the entrance of the place the security guards and people who were doing the reception treated people terribly, they even said that there was no one there special for VIP treatment. The venue did not announce the event that would take place that day, they allowed a guest to enter with a backpack and then the security guard came to our table in the middle of the event and kicked this guest out in the middle of everyone. It was an unnecessary waste of money to experience inhumane and rude service.",1,07/08/2025
Lavelle,"I recently visited this restaurant for a birthday dinner, and unfortunately, the experience was extremely disappointing. The restaurant was severely understaffed, with only one server attending to all tables, which resulted in long wait times, cold food, and overall disorganization.<br><br>Drink refills were taking over an hour to arrive, and at one point, we even had to use our own plastic forks to eat dessert because we couldn’t get proper utensils from the restaurant. I also never received my main course, as it was mistakenly delivered to another table from what the server told me. By the time this was realized—two and a half hours into the evening—I had completely lost my appetite. My friends’ meals arrived cold, adding further to the frustration.<br><br>What was meant to be a special evening ended up being a disappointing and stressful experience. It was clear that other diners felt the same, as the mood throughout the restaurant was tense and noticeably unhappy.<br><br>That said, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to the tall male server with glasses who was managing the entire floor on his own. Despite the overwhelming circumstances, he remained courteous, professional, and did his absolute best to serve everyone. His effort did not go unnoticed.<br><br>It’s disheartening because my last visit here two years ago was genuinely enjoyable—both the food and service were excellent. Sadly, the quality has declined significantly since then, and based on this visit, I won’t be returning",1,07/08/2025
